may
not

in

case
i
shall

how
to

can
never
submit
to

honoured
me
with

c

sustained
inconceivable
losses
by
delaying
the
commissaries
at

many
of
the
carolina
beeves
are
dead
through
ab
solute
poverty
and
the
chief
part
of
them
too
poor
to
slaughter
we
are
at
a
loss
how
to
act
for
want
of
the
mutiny
bill
and
should
be
obliged
to
your
honour
to
have
fifty
or
an
hundred
printed
and
sent
by
the
bearer
there
is
a
clause
in
that
bill
which
if
you
are
not
kind
enough
to
boviate
will
prevent
entirely
the
good
inten
tion
of
it
ie
delaying
the
execution
of
sen

until
your

shall
be
made
ac

with

on
our
march
perhaps
near
the
ohio
when
none
but
strong
par
ties
can
pass
with
safety
at
all
times
it
must
be
attended
with
great
expence
trouble
and
inconve

this
i
represented
to
colonel
corbin
and
some
other
gentlemen
of

when
i
was
down
who
said
that
that
objection
to

would
be
removed
by
your

ours
giving
blank

to
be
filled
up
as

contracted

nothing

i
should
be
glad
you

would
direct
what
is
to
be
done
in
these
ca

and
that
you
would
be
kind
enough
to
desire
the
treasurer
to
send
some
part
of
the
money
in
gold
and

were
this
done
we
might
often
get
necessaries
for

in

when
they
can
not
be
had
here
but
with

it

is
impossible

yesterday
being

only
if
i
had
any
other
than
paper
money
and
you
appro
ved
of
it
i
would
send
to

the

i
am
confident
men
might
be
had
there
your
honor
never
having
given
any
particular
directi

about
the

i
should
be
glad
to
know
whether
you
would
have
more
laid
in
than
what
will
serve
for
twelve
hundred
men
that
i
may
give
orders
accordingly
as
i
can
not
now
conceive
that
any
great
danger
can
be
apprehended
at
fort
cumberland
this
winter
i
am
sensible
that
my
constant
attendance
there
can
not
p
303
letters

be
so
serviceable
as
riding
from

making
the
proper
dispositions
and
seeing
that
all
our
neces
saries
are
forwarded
up
with

i
there
fore
think
it
advisable
to
inform
your

of
it
hoping
that
it
will
correspond
with
your
own
opinion
i
forgot
to
mention
when
i
was
down
that
mr
living
ston
the
fort
major
was
appointed
adjutant
to
our

i
knew
of
none

had
qualified

if

will
expect
to

i
told

where
to

if
he
had
any
such
thoughts
i
believe
on
so
useful
a
business
he
might
be
spared

the

good
effect

or
more
through

few
of

are
acquainted
that
such
a
law
exists
and
there
is
no
other
certain
way
of
bringing
it
to
their
knowledge
there
are
a
great
many
of
the
men

belong

deserted

if

this
