Sir,
I
received
yours
of
the

of
Octo-

inclosing
the
Returns
of
your
Company,
only
this
day.
Ferguson

falling
ill,
by
a
Sore
on
his
arm,
was
ordered
to
halt
here,

he
now
remains
unfit

therefore
I
have
sent

Sergeant
Wilper
has
received
from
Fort
Cumberland

this

Arms
and
Clothing
to
complete
your

He
has
enlisted
three

on
his

and
I
have
or-
dered
Ensign
Fleming,
with
eight
others,
to
join
you;
he
being
a
Surgeon,
he
is
desired
to
take
care
of
your
Company;
for
which
he
will
be
allowed.
You
must
use
your
best
endeavours
to
secure
your
provisions,
and
do
with
it
as
you
see
most
needful:
It
is
impossi-

I
can
direct

it
at
this

As
we
have
contracted

a
large
quantity

already,
you
are
desired
to
engage
no
more

what
will
suffice

Sergeant

waiting
the
return
of
the
waggons
from
the

necessaries
for
Captain
Hoggs
Company;
so
soon
as
they
arrive,
you
are
to
see
that
he
receives
such
things
as
he
has
orders
for,
and
dispatch
him
immediately.
If
no
other
Horses,
belong-

the
Country,
can
be
had
here,
one
of
the
Country
Teams
must
be
stopped,

given

him.
You
must
engage
the
herdsmen
to
remain
with
the
Cattle,
until
they
hear
from
the
Com-
missary
or
from
me.
You
must
engage
all
the
Coopers
you
can
to
make
Barrels
for
packing
the
Beef;
and
if
any
of
the
Soldiers
are
Coopers,
they
must
be
set
im-
mediately
to
work.
You
are
to
receive
from
the
Stores
here
thirty
pounds
of
Goose
shot,
which
you
will
deliver
to
Captain
Ashby's
Company
as
you
pass
by,
directing
him
to
be
particularly
care-
ful
of
it.
If
either
of
the
Captains
of
the

should
apply
to
you
for
Ammu-

you
are

him

shooting
at
Tar-

and
if
there
are
any
who
are
remarkably
awkward,
particular
pains
must
be
taken
with
them.
You
must
observe
on
your

good
order

discipline,
and
see
that
no
irregu-
larities
happen;
and
that
the
men
are
not
allowed
to
pillage
the
Country,
which
was
very
much
complained
of
in
the

3,
1755.
5th
To
the
Honourable
Robert
Dinwiddie,
Esquire;
Governor.
I
have
sent
the
Bearer,
Cap-
tain
John
Mercer
who
has
accompts
to
settle
with
the
Committee
to
the
Treasu-
rer
for
the
balance
of
that
ten
thousand
pounds;
and
to
aquaint
your
Honour,
that
meeting
with
Letters
at
Fredericks-
burgh,
as
I
returned
from
Williamsburgh,
informing
me
that
all
was
peaceable
above
and
that
nothing
was
so
imme-
diately
wanting
as
Salt.
I
got
what
I
could
at
that
place,
and
hastened
on
here
to
engage
more;
to
receive
the
Recruits
that
were
expected
in
and
to
wait
the
ar-
rival
of
the
Vessel
with
arms,
&c.
from
James
River,
in
order
to
forward
them
up
with
the
greater
dispatch.
The
Vessel
is
not
yet
arrived.
I
have
impatiently
expected
to
hear
the
result
of
you
Honours
Letter
to
General
Shirley;
and
with
that

lays
may
not
prove
ominous.
In
that
case,
I
shall
not
know
how
to
act;
for
I
can
never
submit
to
the
command
of
Captain
Dag-
morthy,
since
you
have
honoured
me
with
the
Command
of
the
Virginia
Regiment,
&c.
The
Country
has
sustained
inconceivable
losses
by
delaying
the
Commissaries
at
Williamsburgh
many
of
the
Carolina
Beeves
are
dead,
through
ab-
solute
poverty;
and
the
chief
part
of
them
too
poor
to
slaughter.
We
are
at
a
loss
how
to
act,
for
want
of
the
mutiny
Bill;
and
should
be
obliged
to
your
Honour
to
have
fifty
or
an
hundred
printed,
and
sent
by
the
Bearer.
There
is
a
clause
in
that
Bill,
which
if
you
are
not
kind
enough
to
boviate,
will
prevent
entirely
the
good
inten-
tion
of
it:
i.e.
delaying
the
execution
of
Sen-
tences,
until
your
Honour
shall
be
made
ac-
quainted
with
the
proceedings
of
the
Court.
This,
at
times
when
there
is
the
great-
est
occasion
for
Expamples,
will
be
morally
im-
possible
I
mean
while
we
are
on
our
march;
perhaps
near
the
Ohio
when
none
but
strong
par-
ties
can
pass
with
safety:
at
all
times
it
must
be
attended
with
great
expence,
trouble
and
inconve-
niency.
this
I
represented
to
Colonel
Corbin
and
some
other
Gentlemen
of
the
Council,
when
I
was
down;
who
said
that
that
objection
to
the
bill
would
be
removed,
by
your
Hon-
ours
giving
Blank
Warrants,
to
be
filled
up
as
occasion
should
require.
This
would
effec-
tually
remedy
all
those
Evils,
and
put
things
in
their
proper
channel.
We
suffer
greatly
for
want
of

Kettles:
those
sent
from
below
being
Tin,
are
of
small
duration.
We
shall
also
in
a
little
time,
suffer
as
much
for
want
of
Clothing;
one
can
be
got
in
these
parts:
those
which
Major
Carlyle
and
Dalton
contracted
to
furnish,
we
are
disappointed
off.
Shoes
and
Stockings
we
have,
and
can
get
more
if
wanted,
but
nothing
else.
I
should
be
glad
you
Honor
would
direct
what
is
to
be
done
in
these
ca-
ses;
and
that
you
would
be
kind
enough
to
desire
the
Treasurer
to
send
some
part
of
the
money
in
gold
and
silver:
were
this
done,
we
might
often
get
necessaries
for
the
Regiment
in
Maryland
or
Pennsylvania,
when
they
can
not
be
had
here.
but
with
our
money
it
is
is
impossible;
our
paper
not
passing
there.
The
Recruiting
Service
goes
on
ex-
tremely
slow.
Yesterday
being
a
day
appointed
for
Rendezvousing
at
this
place,
there
came
in
ten
Officers
with
twenty
men
only.
If
I
had
any
other
than
paper
money,
and
you
appro-
ved
of
it;
I
would
send
to
Pennsylvania
and
the
Borders
of
Carolina:
I
am
confident,
men
might
be
had
there.
Your
Honor
never
having
given
any
particular
Directi-
ons
about
the
Provisions;
I
should
be
glad
to
know,
whether
you
would
have
more
laid
in
than
what
will
serve
for
twelve
hundred
men;
that
I
may
give
orders
accordingly.
As
I
can
not
now
conceive,
that
any
great
danger
can
be
apprehended
at
Fort
Cumberland
this
Winter;
I
am
sensible
that
my
constant
attendance
there,
can

be
so
serviceable
as
riding
from
place
to
place
making
the
proper
Dispositions,
and
seeing
that
all
our
neces-
saries
are
forwarded
up
with
dispatch.
I
there-
fore
think
it
advisable
to
inform
your
Honour
of
it,
hoping
that
it
will
correspond
with
your
own
opinion.
I
forgot
to
mention
when
I
was
down,
that
Mr.
Living-
ston,
the
Fort
Major,
was
appointed
adjutant
to
our
Regiment:
I
knew
of
none
else
whose
long
servitude
in
a
military
way,
had
qualified
better
for
the
office,
he
was
appointed
the
17th.
of
September.
Captain
Mercer's
pay,
as
aid
de
camp,
seems
yet
doubtful;
I
should
be
glad
if
your
Honour
would
fix
it:
so
is
Captain
Stewarts:
If
Captain
Stewarts
is
encreased,
I
suppose
all
the
Officers
belonging
to
the
Light
Horse
will
expect
to
have
theirs
augmen-
ted
also.
Colonel
Stephens,
in
a
late
letter,
dis-
covered
an
inclination
to
go
to
the
Creek
and
Che-
rokee
Indians
this
Winter.
I
told
him
where
to
apply,
if
he
had
any
such
thoughts.
I
believe
on
so
useful
a
Business,
he
might
be
spared
until
the
Spring.
If
your
Honor
think
proper
to
or-
der
the
Act
of
Assembly
for
apprehending
Deser-
ters,
and
against
harbouring
them,
to
be
published
every
Sunday
in
each
parish
Church
until
the
people
were
made
acquainted
with
the
Law,
it
would
have
a
very
good
effect.
The
Commonalty
in
gene-
ral,
or
more
through
ignorance
than
design:
few
of
them
are
acquainted
that
such
a
Law
exists:
and
there
is
no
other
certain
way
of
bringing
it
to
their
knowledge.
There
are
a
great
many
of
the
men
that
did
once
belong
to
our
Companies,
deserted
from
the
Regiments
into
which
they
were
draugh-
ted,
that
would
now
gladly
return
if
they

of

If
your
Honor
would
be
kind
enough
to
intimate
this
to
General
Shirley,
or
the
Colonels
of
those
Regiments,
it
would
be
of
service
to
us:
without
leave,
we
dare
not
receive
them.

To
John
Robinson
Esquire,
Speaker.
The
Bearer,
captain
John
Mercer,
having
leave
to
go
down
and
Settle
his
ac-
compts
with
the
Committee;
is
ordered
to
call
upon
you
for
the
balance
of
the
ten
thousand
pounds,
which
I
believe
we
shall
want
before
another
opportunity
may
offer;
this
being
the
time
when
our
demands
for
money
are
greatest.
When
I
left
Willi-
amsburgh,
I
intended
to
proceed
to
Winches-
ter;
but
meeting
with
Letters
at
Fredericks-
burgh,
informing
me
that
peace
prevailed
above,
and
that
nothing
was
immediate-
ly
wanted
but
Salt;
I
came
up
here
to
en-
gage
what
I
could,
and
to
wait
the
arrival
of
some
Recruits
at
this
place;
and
a
vessel
with
sundry
arms,
&c.
for
the
Troops.
This
ves-
sel
left
Williamsburgh
two
days
after
I
did,
and
is
not
yet
arrived:
neither
is
the
Ex-
press
returned,
which
the
Governor
sent
to
General
Shirley
for
Commissions
for
the
Field
officers
of
our
Regiment:
which
gives
me
much
concern;
fearing
that
this
de-
lay
is
ominous.
In
that
case,
I
shall
not
know
how
to
act;
it
will
be
useless

to
go
to
a
place
where
I
am
to
be
commanded
and
directed
by
another,
who
can
have
no
other
pretence,
than
that
of
having
a
commis-
sion
from
the
King.
We
shall
suffer
very
greatly
in
a
little
time,
for
want
of
Clothing
for
the
Soldiers;
and
none
can
be
had
here,
nor
in
short,
I
believe
in
the
Country.
Those
which
Carlyle
and
Dalton
con-
tracted
to
furnish,
we
are
disappointed
in,
and
they
say,
they
have
searched
all
the
Stores
in
Maryland,
as
well
as
this
part
of
Virginia,
and
none
are
able
to
furnish
Clothes.
We
have
sustained
inconceivable
losses
by
the
commis-
saries
delays:
many
of
the
Carolina
Beeves
are
dead,
through
poverty
and
bad
manage-
ment;
and
the
chief
of
them
are
too
poor
