To
the
Honourable
Robert
Dinwiddie,
Esquire;
Governor.
I
have
sent
the
Bearer,
Cap-
tain
John
Mercer
(who
has
accompts
to
settle
with
the
Committee
to
the
Treasu-

for
the
balance
of
that
ten
thousand
pounds;
and
to
aquaint
your
Honour,
that
meeting
with
Letters
at
Fredericks-
burgh,
as
I
returned
from
Williamsburgh,
informing
me
that
all
was
peaceable
above,
and
that
nothing
was
so
imme-
diately
wanting
as
Salt.
I
got
what
I
could
at
that
place,
and
hastened
on
here
to
engage
more;
to
receive
the
Recruits
that
were
expected
in;
and
to
wait
the
ar-
rival
of
the
Ve[sel
with

from
James
River,
in
order
to
forward
them
up
with
the
greater
dispatch.
The

is
not

I
have
impatiently
expected
to

the

lays
may
not
prove
ominous.
In
that
case,
I
shall
not
know
how
to
act;
for
I
can
never
submit
to
the
command
of
Captain
Dag-
morthy,
since
you
have
honoured
me
with
the
Command
of
the
Virginia
Regiment,

The
Country
has
sustained
inconceivable
lo[ses
by
delaying
the
Commi[saries
at
Williamsburgh:
many
of
the
Carolina
Beeves
are
dead,
through
ab-
solute
poverty;
and
the
chief
part
of
them
too
poor
to
slaughter.
We
are
at
a
lo[s
how
to
act,
for
want
of
the
mutiny
Bill;
and
should
be
obliged
to
your
Honour
to
have
fifty
or
an
hundred
printed,
and
sent
by
the
Bearer.
There
is
a
clause
in
that
Bill,
which
if
you
are
not
kind
enough
to
obviate,
will
prevent
entirely
the
good
inten-
tion
of
it:
i.e.
delaying
the
execution
of
Sen-
tences,
until
your
Honour
shall
be
made
ac-
quainted
with
the
proceedings
of
the
Court.
This,
at
times
when
there
is
the
great-
est
occasion
for
Expamples,
will
be
morally
im-
po[sible
(I
mean
while
we
are
on
our
march;
perhaps
near
the
Ohio)
when
none
but
strong
par-
ties
can
pa[s
with
safety:
at
all
times
it
must
be
attended
with
great
expence,
trouble
and
inconve-
niency.
this
I
represented
to
Colonel
Corbin
and
some
other
Gentlemen
of
the
Council,
when
I
was
down;
who
said
that
that
objection
to
the
Bill
would
be
removed,
by
your
Hon-
ours
giving
Blank
Warrants,
to
be
filled
up
as
occasion
should
require.
This
would
effec-
tually
remedy
all
those
Evils,
and
put
things
in
their
proper
channel.

We
shall
also

nothing
else.
I
should
be
glad
your
Honor
would
direct
what
is
to
be
done
in
these
ca-

and
that
you
would
be
kind
enough
to
desire
the
Treasurer
to
send
some
part
of
the
money
in
gold
and
silver:
were
this
done,
we
might
often
get
nece[saries
for

in

or
Pennsylvania,
when
they
can
not
be

with

money

is

impo[sible;

The
recruiting
Service
goes
on
ex-
tremely
slow.
Yesterday
being
a
day
appointed
for
Rendezvousing
at
this
place,
there
came
in
ten
Officers
with
twenty
men
only.
If
I
had
any
other
than
paper
money,
and
you
appro-
ved
of
it;
I
would
send
to
Pennsylvania
and
the
Borders
of
Carolina:
I
am
confident,
men
might
be
had
there.
Your
Honor
never
having
given
any
particular
Directi-
ons
about
the
Provisions;
I
should
be
glad
to
know,
whether
you
would
have
more
laid
in
than
what
will
serve
for
twelve
hundred
men;
that
I
may
give
orders
accordingly.
As
I
can
not
now
conceive,
that
any
great
danger
can
be
apprehended
at
Fort

this
Winter;
I
am
sensible,
that

as
riding
from

making
the
proper
Dispositions,
and
seeing
that
all
our

saries
are
forwarded
up
with

I
there-
fore
think
it
advisable
to
inform
your
Honour
of
it,
hoping
that
it
will
correspond
with
your
own
opinion.
I
forgot
to
mention
when
I
was
down,
that
Mr.
Living-
ston,
the
Fort
Major,
was
appointed
adjutant
to
our
Regiment:
I
knew
of
none
else
whose
long
servitude
in
a
military
way,
had
qualified
better
for
the
office,
he
was
appointed

pay,
as
aid
de

seems
yet
doubtful;
I
should
be
glad
if
your
Honour
would
fix
it:
so
is
Captain
Stewarts:
If
Captain
Stew-
arts
is
encreased,
I
suppose
all
the
Officers
belonging
to
the
Light
Horse
will
expect
to
have
theirs
augmen-
ted
also.
Colonel
Stephens,
in
a
late
letter,
dis-
covered
an
inclination
to
go
to
the
Creek
and
Che-
rokee
Indians
this
Winter.
I
told
him
where
to
ap-
ply,
if
he
had
any
such
thoughts.
I
believe,
on
so
useful
a
Busine[s,
he
might
be
spared
until
the
Spring.
If
your
Honor
think
proper
to
or-
der
the
Act
of
A[sembly
for
apprehending
Deser-
ters,
and
against
harbouring
them,
to
be
published
every
Sunday
in
each
parish
Church,
until
the
people
were
made
acquainted
with
the
Law,
it
would
have
a
very
good
effect.
The
Commonalty
in
gene-
ral,
or
more
through
ignorance
than
design:
few
of
them
are
acquainted
that
such
a
Law
exists:
and
there
is
no
other
certain
way
of
bringing
it
to
their
knowledge.
There
are
a
great
many
of
the
men
that
did
once
belong
to
our
Companies,
deserted

If
your

would
be
kind
enough
to
intimate
this
to
General
Shirley,

of

The

John

upon
you
for

When
I
left

I

to
proceed
to
Winches-

but
meeting
with
Letters
at
Fredericks-

informing
me
that
peace
prevailed
above,

that
nothing
