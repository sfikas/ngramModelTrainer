rose
from
his
breakfastnook
bench
and
came
into
the
livingroom
where
heather
and
steve
stood
aghast
at
his
entrance
he
came
almost
falling
forward
in
an
ungainly
shuffle
neck
thrust
out
arms
dangling
loosely
then
abruptly
he
drew
himself
up
and
walked
on
the
very
tips
of
his
toes
he
stretched
his
arms
drawingin
great
breaths
that
forward
isnt
it
a
glorious
thing
long
awaited
transcendent
event
the
exalted
desire
of
all
mankind
through
all
ages
the
kingdom
of
the
mind
is
at
hand
he
turned
beaming
eyes
upward
and
shook
his
head
slowly
from
side
superfluous
precaution
for
there
was
no
other
car
abroad
and
no
pedestrian
to
cross
his
path
nor
to
wait
at
an
intersection
for
the
light
to
change
at
his
apartment
he
garaged
his
car
and
then
stood
loses
stillness
deadly
portent
steve
awakened
early
and
switched
on
the
set
lightedup
but
gave
only
a
low
buzzing
sound
he
had
just
finished
shaving
when
it
came
on
with
a
flat
voice
repeating
this
is
bbc
calling
this
is
bbc
calling
after
what
seemed
an
undue
period
of
repetition
the
voice
went
on
to
describe
the
landing
of
the
thetan
colony
in
sussex
in
all
its
obscene
details
then
the
radio
went
dead
again
and
steve
had
no
stomach
for
breakfast
it
was
a
beautiful
day
as
firstsofjune
should
be
steve
got
out
the
car
and
traversed
the
same
empty
streets
as
he
had
the
night
before
to
keep
an
appointment
with
heather
coming
around
the
great
mass
of
the
chateau
laurier
he
braked
to
a
screeching
stop
a
flying
saucer
was
tilting
and
dipping
over
the
war
memorial
there
was
a
deep
overtone
that
sang
in
his
ears
with
an
almost
painful
sharpness
he
reversed
and
turned
back
on
mckenzie
avenue
the
the
thetans
he
said
are
presumably
here
to
take
charge
as
it
were
of
the
minds
of
the
people
who
are
probably
falling
all
over
them
selves
in
their
zeal
to
get
their
orders
and
to
carry
them
out
just
what
these
orders
will
be
we
dont
know
now
because
of
prior
hypnosis
we
have
es
caped
thetan
subjugation
this
time
but
we
no
longer
have
any
immunity
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
if
the
thetans
discover
our
mental
independence
they
will
promptly
give
us
their
hypnotic
treatment
if
we
can
avoid
undue
prominence
it
may
be
that
we
can
move
about
pretty
freely
without
detection
if
we
can
well
then
we
interests
what
those
interests
are
beyond
personal
security
i
havent
a
clue
but
who
knows
now
to
summarize
what
i
think
our
course
of
action
should
be
first
to
avoid
the
thetans
like
the
plague
for
they
must
not
find
us
out
second
to
tread
pretty
warily
among
our
own
people
finding
out
just
how
much
freedom
we
can
take
with
safety
and
third
to
study
these
damned
thetans
we
must
learn
all
we
can
about
them
is
just
a
hope
that
we
may
uncover
some
weakness
and
find
a
way
of
fighting
back
at
them
heather
agreed
and
suggested
that
they
use
dan
as
a
specimen
demonstra
ting
how
the
thetan
machinations
had
been
working
out
it
occurred
to
steve
that
this
may
not
have
been
entirely
an
objective
suggestion
on
her
part
but
he
thought
it
a
good
idea
so
they
proceeded
to
see
if
the
coast
was
clear
the
street
was
quiet
and
nor
sound
of
flying
saucers
so
they
ventured
forth
and
made
their
way
on
foot
to
dans
house
dan
came
to
the
door
at
their
ring
but
neglected
to
offer
any
greeting
he
was
deeply
preoccupied
and
it
seemed
that
the
ringing
of
a
doorbell
was
to
him
a
new
and
strange
phenomenon
when
he
finally
beckoned
to
them
to
enter
the
action
gave
the
impression
of
having
been
thought
out
and
their
heads
like
tennis
spectators
as
he
walked
up
and
down
whole
attitude
was
a
mixture
of
impatience
pending
an
awaited
communication
and
of
a
vague
perplexity
respecting
his
surroundings
and
the
purpose
he
was
to
serve
heather
and
steve
tried
to
make
themselves
at
home
steve
switched
on
dans
powerful
worldwide
radio
and
systematically
turned
the
tuning
knob
through
all
the
they
followed
him
to
a
city
bus
stop
on
carling
avenue
where
he
waited
the
bus
stop
was
a
deserted
island
on
an
empty
street
but
not
for
long
for
soon
pedestrians
and
cars
flocked
upon
the
avenue
from
its
many
tributary
streets
it
might
have
been
a
normal
businessday
bustle
except
for
two
anomalies
walked
or
drove
or
waited
as
a
person
possessed
of
a
single
allexclusive
purpose
after
a
long
wait
a
bus
appeared
and
they
followed
the
beaming
dan
aboard
taking
seats
some
rows
behind
him
steve
was
beginning
to
find
the
stereotyped
flattish
happy
faces
very
disconcerting
and
looking
at
heather
he
found
a
welcome
relief
in
her
relatively
long
doleful
one
then
he
would
go
back
to
plato
for
a
final
spell
of
real
days
and
would
return
to
new
york
in
late
little
sorry
if
we
were
not
back
for
christmas
as
arranged
but
he
consoled
himself
by
thinking
that
he
and
angelina
would
have
plenty
of
time
together
in
the
future
and
heaven
alone
knew
when
if
ever
he
would
be
back
on
moon
again
and
able
to
do
research
at
first
hand
into
matters
on
which
the
future
of
everyone
including
angelina
depended
expenses
with
the
people
to
whom
moke
had
sent
him
little
people
who
regarded
him
as
lucky
to
have
descended
from
such
economic
altitudes
tom
dreyfus
had
a
job
on
the
machines
in
the
secretariat
stamp
department
while
sally
sulked
at
home
they
had
been
married
for
six
years
but
the
salary
raise
on
the
expectation
of
which
they
had
done
so
had
not
materialised
do
you
know
i
had
to
send
back
our
bedroom
furniture
in
the
second
year
she
moaned
she
had
contacts
in
political
circles
a
school
friend
of
hers
having
married
lester
peron
a
mocrat
senator
with
a
seat
on
the
board
her
husband
a
fact
he
accepted
as
inevitable
i
guess
sally
made
a
mistake
about
me
he
said
one
evening
when
he
had
been
left
to
cook
his
own
meal
was
a
static
mib
the
middleincomebracket
equivalent
to
aristotle
was
excited
at
the
time
not
by
the
prospect
of
the
us
presidents
visit
but
by
a
great
storm
in
the
photo
sphere
of
the
sun
a
matter
which
on
earth
would
hardly
penetrate
beyond
the
minds
of
astronomers
was
of
general
one
wondered
if
this
greater
awareness
of
the
physical
cosmos
might
with
time
instil
the
reverence
which
on
earth
nature
inspires
especially
when
one
reflected
that
the
rockets
over
which
mr
perons
board
presided
had
it
in
their
power
permanently
to
warp
the
solar
system
true
enough
such
ultimate
weapons
had
not
been
allies
being
more
inferior
than
formerly
to
wcu
in
the
lester
was
not
home
yet
from
his
formidable
duties
and
his
wife
in
the
manner
of
middlebrow
country
lawyer
and
we
were
very
small
4microdebs
werent
we
sally
here
she
had
dropped
her
voice
in
homage
to
the
economic
system
that
was
reverenced
when
he
thought
we
might
get
go
a
bit
better
if
he
entered
politics
know
how
he
did
it
he
s
clever
on
the
mouthorgan
so
when
he
visited
some
craterlet
on
face
ours
is
an
agricultural
as
soon
as
he
had
spoken
a
few
sentences
of
his
speech
cut
the
politics
lester
give
us
something
on
your
came
through
to
4makrodeb
status
and
got
all
these
lovely
things
she
waved
a
plump
hand
towards
her
grand
pianos
etc
at
the
same
time
a
door
banged
but
dont
say
a
word
about
it
lester
wants
his
mouthorgan
to
be
forgotten
now
the
time
has
come
for
him
to
be
taken
seriously
as
entered
a
large
man
who
had
once
been
handsome
but
was
now
seedylooking
a
sufferer
from
stomachulcers
in
the
backface
tradition
he
wore
and
kept
on
indoors
a
fifty
gallon
hat
harry
was
prepared
for
something
unpleasant
for
this
was
the
senator
who
had
annoyed
the
united
states
by
bragging
how
he
had
once
won
a
trick
from
wcu
by
threatening
to
loose
off
one
of
his
rockets
an
admission
which
would
scarcely
help
bluff
to
succeed
the
next
time
and
lately
by
but
privately
he
turned
out
to
be
as
friendly
as
mr
wise
the
tube
manufacturer
to
have
the
same
adolescent
openness
and
freshness
though
perhaps
not
the
same
maturity
one
remembered
that
he
was
a
lawyer
by
training
and
suspected
that
the
points
he
made
so
sharply
in
international
politics
were
as
abstract
to
him
as
those
a
lawyer
makes
in
a
court
of
motive
would
be
the
same
in
both
cases
to
serve
this
home
of
his
in
which
his
heart
lay
here
the
rocket
mans
charm
was
disarming
yet
when
the
time
came
to
leave
harry
felt
as
de
pressed
as
when
he
left
mrs
hallidays
office
exactly
a
month
ago
if
even
mo
statesmen
only
did
what
they
had
to
do
to
get
go
on
an
expan
ding
scale
and
left
the
sumtotal
of
their
actions
and
their
lunar
and
earthly
repercussions
to
luck
the
political
life
of
aristotle
looked
more
and
more
like
a
masquerade
of
business
interests
in
dis
guise
which
far
from
attracting
the
allegiance
of
free
men
everywhere
could
only
repel
them
then
what
of
the
cultural
life
did
this
per
haps
nurture
a
genuinely
civilizing
impulse
which
might
in
time
become
social
fact
and
counteract
the
obsession
with
economics
which
had
grown
up
during
the
moons
first
the
centre
of
each
circle
stood
personnel
and
their
filing
clerks
the
students
had
were
now
being
bought
forward
in
their
turn
by
comparing
personal
appearances
with
university
records
the
agents
of
the
and
women
who
interested
them
and
contracts
would
be
initialled
at
the

of

since
starting

depend
on

scholarship
for
these
fine
young
people
was
closely
geared
to
were
really

so
seeing
them
revolve
in
moke
consciously
or
unconsciously
symbolised
any
way
in

mind
had
these
splendid
young
people
by
the
short
hairs
and
was
diverting
them
to
be
diverted
however
with
the
single
exception
of
one
step
he
looked
as
if
nothing
moke
and
his
neurosis
and
not
in
some
eruption
from
those
transeconomic
once
again
the
metaphysics
were
depressing
and
in
absolute
contrast
to
the
physical
display
mos
have
an
unamerican
love
of
parades
and
these
young
ones
on
parade
for
jobs
which
they
putting
their
best
foot
forward
edge
did
you
notice
and
the
mules
didnt
seem
to
want
to
get
off
the
raft
he
peered
as
it
were
into
the
dark
secrets
night
exceptionally
brilliant
and
strange
for
in
the
proximity
of
the
mountains
whose
presence
i
could
almost
smell
on
the
cosmic
handiwork
all
those
stars
but
i
m
a
bit
earthbound
tonight
trout
i
ve
got
a
queer
feeling
like
i
always
get
when
something
if
you
ask
me
might
be
jaguar
might
be
hope
i
die
kind
of
composed
trout
i
mean
you
cant
imagine
the
christian
martyrs
twisting
and
shrieking
lion
munching
or
arrows
where
it
hurts
most
or
can
you
look
over
there
he
pointed
to
the
shadows
beyond
the
river
something
moved
may
have
thought
i
had
become
unbalanced
through
fear
a
character
mr
gilberto
mentioned
the
forest
indians
are
said
to
be
mortally
afraid
with
a
hoof
shaped
like
the
heel
of
a
bottle
if
your
lordship
will
excuse
me
a
repulsive
creatures
they
were
resemblance
to
the
shrunk
heads
we
had
gazed
at
recently
and
i
have
no
hesitation
in
saying
that
they
would
have
made
an
end
of
us
but
for
an
intervention
so
unexpected
so
unusual
that
only
the
necessity
of
rounding
my
narrative
compels
me
to
mention
it
i
had
a
distinct
impression
that
the
hut
had
recently
been
cleaned
and
prepared
for
visitors
mrs
caine
said
we
were
to
go
no
further
unless
and
until
we
were
sent
for
confirming
another
impression
that
became
more
and
more
definite
namely
that
she
was
in
touch
with
an
invi
sible
source
of
authority
sally
and
of
course
mrs
septimus
for
surely
mr
septimus
stood
in
the
same
case
as
myself
but
was
it
so
i
allowed
myself
to
entertain
for
an
instant
the
idea
the
would
be
inopportune
and
with
the
idea
came
to
watch
mr
septimus
more
closely
mrs
caine
too
and
mr
gilberto
who
would
but
all
three
were
to
the
casual
observation
i
permitted
myself
unruffled
mr
septimus
reserved
and
certainly
very
thoughtful
but
that
was
his
habit
indeed
we
were
all
invaded
by
a
most
tranquil
mood
even
the
indian
servants
relaxed
knowing
so
mr
gilberto
told
us
that
the
wild
and
savage
tribes
never
approached
this
region
at
any
rate
they
remained
with
us
perhaps
for
such
protection
as
our
presence
or
mrs
but
after
what
mrs
caine
had
said
it
was
never
far
from
our
minds
that
at
any
moment
we
were
to
receive
a
summons
i
could
see
that
mr
septimus
was
impatient
for
it
this
afternoon
then
we
climbed
a
promontory
a
mass
of
clean
rock
crowned
with
trees
and
bushes
that
stood
well
out
over
the
lake
no
one
has
ever
satisfactorily
explained
how
a
too
carefree
and
becoming
airborne
caught
by
a
sudden
gust
of
wind
a
combination
of
the
two
no
one
seems
to
know
but
the
fact
remains
that
get
itself
into
orbit
it
did
and
a
fine
old
fuss
there
was
about
it
too
the
bus
the
220
from
dinas
to
llangrwl
aboard
apart
from
the
crew
were
mrs
megan
thomas
and
her
fiveyearold
son
cadwallader
pretty
little
morfydd
owen
mr
stanley
hayball
birmingham
price
the
provisions
and
the
rev
the
bus
set
out
from
dinas
so
much
is
established
ifor
huw
evans
propr
watched
it
go
from
the
windows
of
the
dinas
motor
omnibus
co
very
interested
ifor
was
for
there
was
his
garage
hand
dai
pugh
taking
a
tearful
farewell
of
morfydd
owen
morfydd
who
had
until
recently
been
ifors
typist
but
was
now
returning
to
her
home
town
as
a
fullyfledged
schoolteacher
but
i
m
only
going
fifteen
miles
away
morfydd
was
saying
not
the
end
of
the
world
is
it
for
me
it
is
dai
said
wretchedly
wiping
his
hands
on
his
overalls
preparatory
to
a
last
embrace
you
will
not
be
remembering
a
mere
garage
hand
when
you
are
lording
it
over
the
mixed
infants
of
llangrwl
silly
boy
said
morfydd
though
she
could
not
help
wondering
whether
now
she
had
qualified
as
a
schoolteacher
poor
little
dai
was
quite
the
man
for
her
a
nice
boy
of
course
but
perhaps
in
the
new
world
she
was
entering
there
might
be
boys
equally
nice
and
with
far
more
to
offer
the
conductor
rang
his
bell
goodbye
dai
said
morfydd
smiling
from
the
bottom
step
she
was
already
up
the
bus
steps
and
the
bus
was
away
and
morfydd
owen
waving
unkissed
from
the
window
and
dai
on
the
pavement
knowing
in
his
heart
that
morfydd
was
leaving
him
as
surely
as
she
was
leaving
dinas
so
the
bus
set
out
for
llangrwl
but
it
never
reached
there
somewhere
on
those
fifteen
miles
of
mountain
roads
it
disappeared
from
the
earthly
scene
the
first
intimation
that
all
was
not
well
came
when
a
mr
isaiah
roberts
landlord
of
the
travellers
joy
rang
up
the
dinas
motor
omnibus
co
to
ask
what
had
happened
to
their
damn
start
running
punctual
and
where
are
you
people
get
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
tendentious
mr
roberts
sounded
and
scour
the
countryside
between
here
and
the
travellers
joy
the
twotwenty
to
llangrwl
has
failed
to
complete
her
mission
paled
did
dai
for
the
twotwenty
carried
for
him
a
cargo
more
precious
than
jewels
though
mofydd
owen
was
as
he
feared
departed
out
of
his
life
he
still
loved
her
dearly
already
even
as
with
trembling
fingers
he
fastened
his
trouser
clips
he
was
seeing
her
lying
in
some
dreadful
ravine
or
beset
by
robbers
or
being
whisked
off
to
emergency
ward
even
his
imagination
luckily
for
him
did
not
visualise
the
awful
truth
that
morfyyd
owen
was
already
qualifying
for
cadwallader
when
his
child
mind
grasped
the
fact
that
the
green
earth
was
falling
away
at
a
rate
of
knots
where
indeed
megan
thomas
spoke
sharply
to
the
conductor
demanding
an
explanation
but
nonplussed
the
conductor
was
a
good
man
mind
knew
his
job
but
out
of
depth
in
this
particular
instance
fingered
his
ticketpunch
nervously
peered
out
of
the
window
went
and
consulted
the
driver
where
are
we
going
he
echoed
cadwallader
but
something
very
untoward
has
immersed
in
the
dinas
advertiser
was
the
rev
edwards
now
he
put
down
his
paper
folded
it
and
glanced
idly
out
of
the
window
looked
again
eyes
starting
from
his
head
god
bless
my
immortal
soul
he
cried
never
mind
your
immortal
soul
said
megan
thomas
tartly
here
we
are
traversing
the
heavens
at
the
very
moment
when
we
should
be
running
into
llangrwl
bus
station
and
no
one
doing
the
first
thing
about
it
stung
the
conductor
was
what
you
expect
me
to
do
he
inquired
bitter
radio
flying
control
at
london
airport
us
nowhere
boomed
the
rev
edwards
it
s
all
very
well
commented
mr
hayball
from
the
back
seat
but
eth
and
me
wanted
to
be
at
the
youth
hostel
before
dark
morfydd
owen
was
silent
but
she
looked
down
at
the
fastdisappearing
earth
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
would
never
see
her
dai
again
and
though
half
an
hour
ago
she
had
regarded
this
possibility
with
fortitude
it
now
filled
her
with
dismay
quietly
she
began
to
weep
meanwhile
was
pedalling
furiously
on
the
road
not
a
sign
of
the
bus
he
passed
the
travellers
joy
at
last
he
caught
up
mr
roberts
walking
very
dogged
towards
llangrwl
afternoon
mr
roberts
he
called
polite
as
he
shot
past
his
spirits
were
rising
he
had
seen
no
sign
of
an
accident
therefore
mr
roberts
must
have
been
mistaken
he
would
find
the
bus
safe
and
sound
in
llangrwl
and
his
dear
morfydd
quietly
but
disappointment
awaited
him
a
restive
queue
of
people
in
the
bus
station
waiting
to
be
transported
to
dinas
and
when
he
went
to
morfydds
house
all
he
found
was
morfydds
mam
working
herself
up
proper
getting
dark
now
the
conductor
switched
on
the
lights
the
beleaguered
passengers
peered
out
of
the
windows
little
to
be
seen
only
a
few
lone
stars
and
the
distant
earth
brooding
in
her
shroud
of
mist
megan
thomas
sat
tightlipped
nursing
the
sleeping
cadwallader
driver
and
conductor
peered
ahead
into
nothingness
on
the
back
seat
stan
hayball
embraced
his
eth
morfydd
thought
of
dai
the
rev
edwards
standing
at
the
front
looked
at
his
forlorn
flock
what
he
suggested
hopefully
sank
if
the
welsh
found
the
situation
too
desperate
for
singing
then
the
situation
he
realised
must
be
desperate
indeed
but
suddenly
they
were
roused
from
their
lethargy
something
was
approaching
faster
faster
a
tearing
hurrying
blur
that
was
past
and
gone
in
a
moment
followed
by
a
great
rush
of
sound
they
waved
frantically
but
the
jet
aircraft
was
already
miles
away
swinging
down
to
the
darkening
earth
it
passed
me
at
fifty
thousand
feet
sir
it
was
climbing
steadily
group
captain
llewelyn
jones
officer
commanding
raf
station
dinas
looked
keenly
at
the
flying
officer
who
had
burst
so
unceremoniously
into
his
office
and
what
did
it
look
like
broughtons
some
sort
well
actually
sir
it
looked
like
like
a
bus
a
singledecker
he
elaborated
daggers
the
group
captain
looked
broughtons
he
said
silkily
didnt
they
teach
you
at
cranwell
that
buses
are
buses
crawl
very
pale
broughtons
was
but
waving
like
gimlets
the
station
commanders
eyes
did
you
see
the
indicator
board
yes
sir
and
what
did
it
say
mystery
tour
oh
very
caustic
that
group
captain
but
broughtons
stood
his
ground
no
back
in
his
chair
i
see
so
you
met
a
bus
at
fifty
lit
up
full
of
people
waving
as
you
went
past
suddenly
he
crouched
forward
broughtons
if
i
thought
i
d
have
you
courtmartialled
but
i
know
there
isnt
he
ended
sadly
i
tried
to
read
the
registration
number
sir
but
it
was
getting
dark
he
waited
but
his
commanding
officer
appeared
to
he
saluted
and
left
the
presence
very
crestfallen
time
passed
the
bus
climbed
and
went
quietly
into
orbit
time
passed
the
rev
edwards
pulpit
remained
empty
and
so
did
the
arms
of
dai
pugh
how
could
they
be
otherwise
when
his
beloved
was
circling
the
poles
at
threeanda
quarterhour
intervals
regular
as
clockwork
time
passed
everyone
said
pity
about
megan
it
was
a
pity
at
all
as
indeed
they
didnt
dinas
advertiser
but
the
london
papers
ignored
the
whole
affair
ifor
evans
reported
his
loss
a
bus
is
it
very
careless
that
was
their
attitude
now
if
there
d
been
a
good
old
accident
they
could
have
measured
up
the
road
and
taken
losing
a
bus
people
were
always
losing
things
you
d
be
surprised
they
said
so
it
seemed
for
a
time
that
the
whole
affair
would
be
written
off
as
one
of
those
unexplained
mysteries
like
the
marie
celeste
then
things
began
to
happen
but
what
about
the
voyagers
you
the
rev
edwards
had
taken
command
our
position
he
said
is
somewhat
analogous
to
that
of
a
castaway
on
a
desert
island
now
what
does
such
a
person
do
he
signals
his
position
by
lighting
bonfires
or
hoisting
a
flag
on
a
palm
tree
and
he
tries
to
ensure
a
cant
go
lighting
bonfires
on
this
bus
the
conductor
said
firmly
contrary
to
the
the
minister
no
we
have
another
way
of
signalling
our
position
the
driver
must
sound
his
horn
continuously
gave
him
a
look
the
driver
did
where
you
think
we
are
he
asked
rudely
do
as
i
say
driver
very
stern
the
reverend
gentleman
was
so
the
driver
peeppeeped
as
through
empty
space
thank
you
the
rev
edwards
said
courteously
secondly
we
must
pool
and
ration
our
supplies
of
food
if
any
a
now
who
has
any
food
he
asked
hopefully
mr
price
i
think
you
may
be
able
to
help
us
here
said
the
rev
edwards
price
shook
his
head
intended
for
plas
newydd
this
lot
is
paid
for
too
he
folded
his
arms
protectively
over
the
basket
mutinous
dog
thought
the
rev
edwards
who
hadnt
enjoyed
himself
so
much
since
reading
treasure
island
what
have
you
got
in
that
basket
price
he
roared
quelled
mr
price
pulled
out
a
grocery
list
pushed
his
glasses
up
on
his
nose
and
began
to
read
six
loaves
four
pounds
butter
two
pounds

one
tin

the

said
suddenly
his
second
head
roused
itself
and
declared
to
be
a
good
shape

not
all
in

also
good

gasped
flor
yes
we

to

you
must
help
to
lead
our
force
the
long
afternoon
of
eternity
wore
on
that
long
golden
road
of
an
afternoon
that
would
somewhere
lead
to
everlasting
there
was
but
motion
without
event
except
for
those
negligible
events
that
seemed
so
large
to
the
creatures
participating
in
them
for
lilyyo
flor
and
haris
there
were
many
events
chief
of
these
was
that
they
learned
to
fly
properly
the
pains
associated
with
their
wings
soon
died
away
as
the
wonderful
new
flesh
and
tendon
strengthened
to
sail
up
in
the
light
gravity
became
an
increasing
delight
the
ugly
flopping
movements
of

on
the
heavy
world
had
was
a
bachelor
all
his
life
he
had
been
inclined
to
regard
women
as
something
which
must
necessarily
be
subordinated
to
his
career
now
he
realised
that
he
was
entrusting
not
only
his
own
life
but
geoffreys
as
well
to
a
strange
girl
whom
he
had
never
met
and
on
whom
after
no
more
than
a
couple
of
telephone
calls
he
was
it
was
a
novel
experience
alastair
was
quite
unable
to
explain
why
he
should
feel
so
much
confidence
in
her
once
again
she
checked
back
her
instructions
it
was
obvious
that
she
did
not
fail
to
appreciate
the
faith
which
he
was
placing
in
her
and
was
prepared
to
accept
the
responsibility
evening
and
i
shall
look
forward
to
meeting
you
both
at
midnight
they
might
have
been
arranging
a
supper
party
then
she
rang
off
alastair
admitted
that
never
in
a
not
altogether
uneventful
life
had
he
come
across
a
girl
who
sounded
so
charming
and
appeared
to
be
so
efficient
some
reason
the
orderlies
had
forgotten
to
switch
on
the
lights
there
was
no
colour
physical
features
were
distinguishable
solely
by
gradations
of
silvery
greyness
even
the
snow
capped
summit
of
mont
blanc
seven
miles
below
was
not
recognisable
among
the
host
of
lower
peaks
the
screen
of
the
airtoair
radar
glowed
occasionally
minute
spots
flickered
across
its
surface
but
there
was
in
the
exceptional
clarity
he
was
even
able
to
make
a
direct
comparison
between
the
radar
image
and
the
ground
itself
ahead
lay
the
plain
of
lombardy
to
the
right
turin
to
the
left
milan
the
directional
angle
of
the
scanner
could
be
adjusted
to
cover
any
particular
area
within
its
range
geoffrey
ground
immediately
ahead
he
was
able
to
pick
out
towns
unrecognisable
to
the
naked
eye
obscured
by
the
ground
haze
which
even
on
the
clearest
night
limited
angular
vision
he
glanced
at
the
speed
recorder
it
seemed
almost
incredible
that
the
tiny
white
figure
of
85
against
which
the
needle
was
resting
could
really
mean
hundreds
of
knots
now
as
alastair
reduced
the
thrust
the
pitch
changed
as
the
nose
of
the
aircraft
dipped
slightly
the
needle
of
the
speed
before
coming
to
rest
at
50
we
re
a
bit
smiled
alastair
talked
of
running
in
when
they
were
still
more
than
four
hundred
miles
from
their
destination
they
were
nearing
modena
geoffrey
focused
the
radar
scanner
by
special
helicopter
from
the
horse
guards
geoffrey
set
himself
to
consider
the
movements
of
the
bentley
it
had
passed
him
at
the
temporary
bridge
over
the
tartaro
at
a
few
minutes
past
ten
on
the
previous
night
he
worked
out
the
distance
on
the
presumption
that
its
route
had
been
through
florence
and
rome
and
then
across
italy
via
foggia
to
barletta
it
came
to
just
over
six
hundred
miles
had
descended
like
a
curtain
by
the
time
they
docked
at
belleray
and
though
guy
made
nervous
by
beryls
silence
drove
at
reckless
speed
to
the
villa
it
was
quickly
evident
that
the
party
was
over
piers
came
strolling
out
to
meet
the
deanes
and
as
soon
as
guy
had
driven
away
invited
them
casually
to
come
to
his
beryl
at
least
this
was
anticlimax
with
a
vengeance
she
had
expected
to
be
met
with
violent
reproaches
and
here
he
was
bland
and
smiling
but
it
did
not
take
her
long
to
realise
that
his
mood
was
less
pleasant
than
appeared
on
the
surface
he
told
her
nonchalantly
as
he
led
the
way
to
his
own
veranda
that
he
had
taken
the
liberty
of
asking
jack
as
a
representative
of
the
vallin
family
to
come
over
and
make
the
presentation
in
her
stead
i
caught
him
just
as
he
was
going
to
the
of
fact
i
d
asked
him
last
night
to
deputise
for
me
and
fetch
her
he
brought
her
to
the
party
said
the
first
thing
that
came
into
her
head
casual
tone
she
s
not
returning
to
her
family
she
s
going
to
live
with
friends
of
the
bank
manager
just
this
side
of
belleray
mrs
deane
made
a
suitable
comment
but
beryl
said
nothing
she
was
trying
to
sort
things
out
in
her
mind
that
beneath
his
unnaturally
smooth
exterior
piers
was
simmering
with
anger
against
her
she
had
no
doubt
had
had
a
thoroughly
good
time
and
it
would
take
them
nearly
to
next
week
to
settle
down
again
meanwhile
hubert
would
have
betaken
himself
and
his
well
it
was
all
over
and
done
with
for
the
time
being
beryl
was
content
to
let
it
go
at
that
but
she
resolved
to
have
it
out
with
piers
when
a
reasonable
opportunity
presented
itself
he
must
learn
that
he
could
not
treat
her
with
injustice
and
contempt
ignoring
her
explanations
as
though
he
were
a
schoolmaster
and
she
a
small
ignorant
gave
her
no
chance
of
any
private
conversation
that
evening
for
when
blanche
and
jack
left
he
went
with
them
but
next
morning
she
insisted
on
his
taking
her
out
in
the
jeep
to
find
if
possible
hubert
and
his
her
great
disappointment
at
being
held
up
in
balicou
with
an
air
of
resignation
he
sent
judy
his
boxer
to
the
back
and
made
room
for
her
beside
him
is
that
all
you
want
to
do
he
asked
letting
in
the
clutch
no
i
want
to
make
you
understand
just
what
happened
about
this
balicou
trip
she
returned
coldly
i
m
a
little
tired
of
being
treated
like
an
ineffective
imbecile
and
i
m
heartily
sick
of
being
constantly
called
to
account
for
my
manners
he
retorted
what
have
i
done
wrong
now
i
cover
up
for
you
the
best
way
i
can
by
getting
hold
of
jack
to
make
the
presentation
i
run
the
damned
party
to
the
best
of
my
ability
saying
the
sugary
things
you
ought
to
have
been
there
fault
as
though
it
was
only
what
you
expected
of
me
and
understand
all
the
whys
and
wherefores
of
your
actions
he
said
stiffly
still
less
to
criticise
you
oh
drop
that
nonsense
piers
be
yourself
she
exclaimed
with
mounting
exasperation
very
well
he
brought
the
jeep
to
a
standstill
in
a
rough
path
fringed
and
shaded
by
citrus
trees
if
you
want
my
true
opinion
i
ll
give
it
you
made
some
sort
of
a
protest
to
graybury
i
ll
give
you
credit
for
that
but
you
didnt
press
the
matter
because
very
naturally
you
were
thoroughly
enjoying
forrests
company
in
idyllic
surroundings
how
dare
you
say
such
a
thing
she
blazed
for
goodness
sake
show
a
glimmer
of
reason
was
his
equally
indignant
rejoinder
she
avoided
his
gaze
and
tried
to
ignore
that
last
impertinent
remark
with
four
other
people
whom
you
never
once
managed
to
circumvent
the
mockery
in
his
voice
had
deepened
with
all
due
deference
miss
deane
come
off
it
she
met
his
eyes
then
slowly
if
you
must
drag
the
truth
out
of
me
i
must
ask
you
to
regard
it
as
confidential
my
dear
beryl
dont
tell
me
anything
if
you
d
rather
not
he
was
clearly
startled
by
her
not
i
who
started
this
conversation
air
of
smiling
somnolence
showed
them
celebrations
and
their
friendly
welcome
and
warm
sympathy
as
she
explained
how
she
had
come
to
miss
the
party
made
her
send
a
complacent
glance
in
piers
direction
what
a
fussbox
the
man
was
she
thought
impatiently
on
the
estate
was
a
major
error
and
then
she
received
a
jolt
old
hubert
standing
beside
her
his
battered
hat
in
his
hand
his
toothless
mouth
stretched
in
a
wide
grin
told
her
in
halting
6patois
that
3mistah
piers
had
explained
right
at
the
start
that
3mis
beryl
that
it
wouldnt
be
her
fault
at
all
that
she
was
a
lady
who
like
her
uncle
charles
took
the
highest
pride
in
keeping
her
word
i
could
see
3anudder

he
went
on
in
a
lower
voice
his
sunken
black
eyes
twinkling

we
all
know
how
balicou
island
dangerous
to
all
kin
o
boats
wid
dose
big
big
rocks
in
an
out
o
de
water
he
had
almost
entirely
settled
back
into
his
old
ways
even
to
reading
law
about
two
hours
each
day
though
he
did
not
refuse
wine
which
the
did
not
act
as
though
he
found
it
necessary
except
in
moderate
compliance
with
his
fathers
habit
that
rounded
rocky
promontory
where
the
triangular
sail
and
to
the
judges
frightened
eyes
so
close
to
the
rocks
that
it
would
be
dashed
that
boy
that
damned
fool
boy
what
does
he
mean
what
does
time
mean
when
weighed
against
the
life
of
two
human
beings
not
until
he
was
certain
that
the
yawl
had
rounded
the
rocky
point
instead
of
being
flung
against
the
huge
boulders
did
the
judge
empty
his
lungs
of
stifling
air
and
refill
them
with
part
of
that
howling
northwest
gale
when
the
wind
was
on
a
rampage
as
it
was
now
it
could
kick
up
a
seasized
commotion
where
it
had
a
straight
blow
of
eight
miles
down
the
lake
3
big
blow
judge
re
marked
willie
kim
as
the
wind
billowed
out
and
sucked
in
his
baggy
black
blouse
blow
like
hell
maybe
by
and
by
she
blow
some
more
hello
willie
where
did
you
come
from
the
judge
said
in
mild
surprise
i
didnt
hear
you
do
you
see
that
fool
boy
of
mine
out
there
on
the
lake
3
i
see
him
you
dont
need
worry
judge
big
wind
like
that
cant
drown
is
good
man
and
bueno
buck
is
raised
on
lake
he
no
drown
too
him
his

throw
him
into
water
to
make
him
swim
when
he
is
born
maybe
so
bill
he
can
swim
that
good
too
the
yawl
riding
the
high
waves
with
an
air
that
might
have
made
an
ocean
liner
envious
seemed
prepared
to
make
a
safe
though
violent
landing
from
my
god
the
judge
cried
out
the
boy
is
going
to
try
to
make
a
landing
on
the
willie
kim
was
speechless
only
his
slant
black
eyes
showing
any
emotion
with
a
quick
shift
of
tiller
and
at
the
same
time
jibbing
the
boom
to
which
he
had
the
stay
rope
fastened
bill
made
the
yawl
seemed
to
the
frightened
judge
as
though
his
son
would
actually
shoot
the
craft
in
under
the
outer
end
of
the
wharf
but
by
pressing
the
tiller
hard
over
and
at
the
same
time
dropping
the
small
sheet
of
wet
canvas
bill
cleared
the
corner
of
the
pier
by
inches
and
with
the
tiller
still
hard
over
brought
the
yawl
up
against
the
waves
that
was
as
pretty
a
piece
of
seamans
hip
as
i
ever
saw
that
boy
of
mine
seems
to
know
how
to
do
everything
when
he
wants
to
3naw
disputed
willie

just
play
in
damn
fine
luck
this
time
he
plenty
smart
though
as
they
reached
the
pier
the
judge
on
legs
that
were
a
little
unsteady
they
found
bueno
buck
now
on
the
werent
worried
we
re
going
to
drag
the
boat
ashore
and
turn
her
over
she
has
a
foot
of
water
in
her
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
we
broke
all
speed
records
on
the
way
in
yes
sir
i
am
slightly
wet
and
buck
would
be
wetter
if
he
had
more
clothes
on
with
four
doing
the
job
and
the
waves
dragged
out
but
before
it
was
turned
over
bueno
buck
reached
into
the
foot
of
water
tossed
out
a
string
of
silvery
lake
trout
and
said
3
bill
he
s
better
man
at
catch
em
than
injun
judge
you
look
little
one
more
as
fifteen
inches
maybe
big
one
four
feet
huh
by
george
that
is
a
beautiful
string
of
fish
exclaimed
the
judge
toss
them
on
the
grass
few
moments
later
the
yawl
was
upside
down
exposing
its
shallow
keel
bertrams
face
was
grim
you
think
it
was
the
snort
dont
you
john
gave
a
short
laugh
i
did
he
said
but
i
d
better
stop
thinking
that
now
pericles
is
fitted
with
an
identically
similar
one
so
there
you
are
my
dear
peggy
s
eyes
filled
with
tears
it
s
so
unfair
she
said
that
little
beast
robbie
munyard
spent
six
months
ashore
while
pericles
was
refitting
in
the
dockyard
and
now
that
she
s
ready
for
sea
he
goes
sick
just
because
he
s
an
honourable
he
can
do
what
he
likes
anyway
why
pick
on
you
to
succeed
a
submariners
wife
needed
to
be
spared
as
much
as
possible
anyway
the
parsifal
affair
was
far
too
fresh
in
both
their
minds
to
be
a
comfortable
we
can
do
with
the
extra
money
it
ll
just
about
pay
jackys
school
fees
what
shall
we
do
about
this
house
and
jills
school
and
oh
how
i
d
known
what
it
would
be
like
i
d
sooner
work
on
sundays
he
said
they
re
worse
off
than
submariners
you
ought
to
have
married
that
fat
stockbroker
chap
and
shared
him
with
his
three
mistresses
anyway
it
might
be
much
worse
pericles
is
a
portsmouth
boat
she
spends
longer
in
harbour
than
any
other
submarine
practically
a
shore
job
cheer
up
she
wiped
her
eyes
and
reached
for
her
address
book
i
ll
write
to
those
agents
and
try
to
get
a
flat
in
alverstoke
she
said
but
i
dont
know
what
blessing
that
jacky
s
off
to
boarding
school
and
all
the
trouble
you
ve
taken
with
the
garden
little
beast
robbie
munyard
having
said
her
say
peggy
manfully
shouldered
her
another
home
in
the
ten
years
of
married
life
this
had
already
happened
half
a
dozen
times
such
is
the
life
of
a
naval
officers
wife
johns
father
had
been
a
naval
officer
of
the
old
school
some
of
his
rigid
ideas
had
been
passed
on
to
the
second
generation
one
of
these
was
that
an
officer
should
join
a
ship
on
taking
up
a
new
appointment
at
nine
am
precisely
dressed
in
the
modern
equivalent
of
frockcoat
and
sword
it
would
have
been
acceptable
to
all
concerned
if
john
had
stepped
into
fort
blockhouse
clad
in
plainclothes
on
the
previous
night
but
ways
instilled
by
martinet
parents
have
a
habit
of
famous
portsmouth
hostelry
second
only
in
historic
interest
to
the
george
unhappily
destroyed
by
german
bombs
during
the
last
war
having
deposited
his
baggage
and
unpacked
his
overnightbag
he
went
in
search
of
a
drink
the
lower
bar
was
empty
save
for
the
lady
known
by
all
habitue
man
who
was
staring
moodily
into
a
gin
and
have
been
worth
a
great
deal
to
the
proprietors
of
the
hotel
she
greeted
john
however
with
less
than
her
usual
cordiality
and
flashed
a
warning
glance
at
him
evidently
the
other
occupant
of
the
bar
was
not
6persona
grata
if
her
gin
he
turned
to
seaweed
make
it
a
large
one
darling
i
know
the
naval
habits
drink
gin
and
call
each
other
wallahs
from
a
visit
to
the
royal
navy
submarines
what
youngest
dsc
in
the
war
what
crawled
inside
a
submarine
casing
to
defuse
a
jerry
bomb
should
have
been
a
vc
obviously
thirsty
john
fought
back
his
inherited
desire
to
snub
the
man
if
he
did
he
would
have
to
leave
the
bar
and
either
sit
in
the
lounge
or
return
to
his
bedroom
seaweed
sensed
his
embarrassment
and
came
to
the
rescue
you
havent
introduced
yourself
she
said
with
mock
severity
nature
i
assumed
that
you
both
knew
who
i
in
held
out
his
hand
and
john
could
not
do
commander
he
said
now
what
about
that
one
in
return
and
he
was
lonely
a
lieutenantcommander
perhaps
we
could
drop
the
rank
such
a
mouthful
you
re
his
glass
fill
it
up
darling
accuracy
above
all
else
we
pride
ourselves
about
accuracy
on
the
and
countercheck
nothing
but
the
truth
gin
with
relish
it
was
his
favourite
brand
he
was
on
the
verge
of
a
new
chapter
in
his
career
and
his
companions
attitude
was
challenging
at
home
and
in
bath
had
been
a
trifle
too
comfortable
and
humdrum
he
d
never
before
met
a
pressman
and
bawley
the
truth
is
usually
very
embarra
said
to
take
over
command
of
pericles
am
i
he
said
expense
account
you
re
a
married
your
substance
on
a
complete
stranger
set
em
it
said
bawley
the
proprietor
of
the
daily
courier
knows
what
s
going
on
if
he
doesnt
mind
why
should
you
i
see
john
took
the
refilled
glass
and
looked
over
the
rim
at
his
companion
you
want
me
to
talk
is
that
it
you
misjudge
me
said
bawley
you
have
of
course
on
one
condition
said
john
we
give
him
the
publicity
the
honourable
sort
of
thing
you
ll
get
nothing
out
of
me
tell
george
to
bring
in
the
6carte
du
jour
host
and
a
splendid
raconteur
the
evening
passed
all
too
quickly
as
they
parted
in
the
vestibule
the
two
men
were
well
disposed
towards
each
other
give
me
a
ring
at
this
number
and
i
ll
john
took
it
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
up
been
out
in
a
submarine
i
ll
give
you
a
spin
round
one
of
these
days
if
you
like
you
could
write
it
up
bawley
made
a
face
not
in
pericles
old
man
why
not
better
ask
robbie
munyard
what
s
he
been
saying
john
was
furious
the
little
squirt
to
go
gassing
to
a
newspaper
man
look
he
went
on
earnestly
you
re
not
going
to
write
up
pericles
in
some
way
or
other
are
you
what
is
there
to
write
up
said
bawley
there
are
fortythree
submarines
in
the
navy
why
should
i
pick
on
pericles
john
eyed
him
steadily
it
s
the
parcifal
business
isnt
it
he
said
quietly
more
so
than
ever
since
i
met
you
what
did
munyard
say
the
snort
hull
fitting
fractured
supposing
i
was
to
tell
you
that
we
ve
had
pericles
entire
snort
equipment
removed
said
munyard
didnt
tell
me
that
but
i
must
confess
i
m
relieved
but
it
still
doesnt
do
away
with
the
possibility
of
faulty
design
he
held
out
his
hand
maybe
i
will
take
a
trip
with
you
i
ll
tell
my
editor
that
the
story
s
a
dead
bird
glad
i
met
you
dont
forget
to
give
me
a
ring
any
time
knock
twice
and
ask
for
bawley
what
i
dont
know
when
that
will
be
said
john
i
shall
be
busy
for
a
while
cleaning
up
after
master
bloody
munyard
there
were
six
submarines
lying
in
pairs
alongside
the
jetty
at
fort
blockhouse
black
and
grimly
businesslike
they
both
looked
and
sounded
for
all
of
them
were
rumbling
as
they
charged
their
electric
batteries
a
light
wind
wafted
the
smoke
of
diesel
exhaust
in
through
the
open
windows
of
the
captains
house
it
pervaded
every
room
but
neither
harry
nor
madeleine
turton
noticed
its
existence
as
they
sat
in
silence
over
a
substantial
breakfast
although
usually
a
very
talkative
lady
madeleine
respected
her
husbands
silences
for
she
knew
they
betokened
a
worry
of
some
had
been
many
such
breakfasts
lately
since
the
affair
of
parsifal
harry
had
lost
a
good
deal
of
weight
his
normal
placid
and
steadygoing
manner
remained
but
she
could
see
that
it
no
longer
came
naturally
it
is
the
common
lot
of
all
squadron
senior
officers
to
experience
such
catastrophes
as
the
loss
of
a
submarine
though
in
peace
time
these
happenings
are
few
and
far
is
the
testing
time
for
all
the
affair
blows
up
into
a
national
disaster
and
then
when
it
is
all
over
life
must
continue
as
before
during
this
period
the
captain
must
present
an
unruffled
appearance
and
carry
on
as
if
nothing
unusual
has
happened
harry
turton
had
written
letters
to
the
bereaved
had
visited
many
in
the
locality
had
been
interviewed
by
the
press
had
driven
his
surviving
submarines
a
good
deal
harder
than
usual
and
in
fact
had
applied
all
the
usual
specifics
suitable
rode
down
to
where
i
was
waiting
i
was
thinking
what
a
skill
he
had
for
reading
my
mind
this
would
be
as
good
a
place
near
me
yes
i
said
it
ll
be
here
to
morrow
as
likely
as
not
i
paused
miss
jeannie
ll
be
on
that
coach
dan
yes
he
said
i
know
no
harm
must
come
men
who
ll
be
after
that
coach
i
m
interested
in
johnny
i
know
but
if
lead
starts
but
i
reckon
they
ll
be
too
busy
shooting
at
us
to
bother
with
the
coach
and
the
folks
in
maybe
i
said
but
we
ve
got
to
remember
that
girl
all
the
time
dan
i
feel
kind
of
responsible
for
her
of
course
he
said
giving
me
one
of
his
strange
looks
then
he
and
have
a
look
at
the
mining
camp
working
for
as
well
as
the
townsfolk
and
the
something
of
a
start
i
remembered
the
man
who
d
brought
us
into
this
business
maybe
you
dont
know
about
appleton
i
said
i
watched
him
because
i
was
always
fascinated
by
the
way
he
looked
when
you
tried
to
surprise
him
dead
he
said
yes
dead
shuffled
out
of
the
deck
blasted
down
with
a
shotgun
outside
the
palace
last
fenton
or
somers
he
said
or
the
town
marshal
i
added
his
face
was
fixed
his
horse
back
off
the
trail
and
up
the
slope
leading
to
the
ridge
i
followed
from
the

you
could
see
something
of
the
wild
hill
country
that
lay
all
round
gilburg
crossing
the
air
was
fresh
and
clear
and
you
could
see
far
over
west
and
north
for
many
miles
the
real
high
country
of
the
rockies
lifted
up
in
the
distance
like
a
pale
water
colour
drawing
between
us
and
that
lay
a
vast
stretch
of
hills
canyons
buttes
and
malpais
dan
if
we
head
west
we
ought
to
cut
the
trail
leading
from
gilburg
to
the
north
so
we
swung
west
making
slow
going
over
rough
country
sliding
on
shale
climbing
down
into
draws
circling
a
big
mesa
by
a
four
or
five
mile
valley
sandyfloored
it
got
hotter
as
the
day
wore
on
and
we
rested
gratefully
by
a
small
creek
where
we
watered
the
horses
and
drank
enough
to
cure
our
thirst
hours
riding
brought
us
to
a
trail
that
we
turned
north
into
it
and
after
about
four
miles
it
led
into
a
small
canyon
which
opened
out
into
a
wide
shallow
draw
here
in
a
driedup
creekbed
we
found
the
miners
at
work
they
were
scattered
over
a
fairly
wide
area
working
singly
or
of
the
diggings
there
was
a
roughlybuilt
shack
and
as
we
got
near
someone
inside
bawled
out
if
you
come
any
closer
i
ll
sure
blow
your
whiskers
off

it

and
tell
nick
dowd
we
ve
come
to
talk
to
him
about
what
happened
last
night
whistle
then
loud
and
shrill
the
gun
barrel
peeking
out
through
a
hole
in
the
shack
never
wavered
we
sat
our
horses
waiting
looks
as
though
they
re
expecting
trouble
i
said
where
observed
dan
shifting
about
in
his
saddle
he
was
saw
several
men
running
down
towards
as
the
nearest
of
them

round
the
shack

reason
for

said
still
long
as
you
re
here

as
well
stay
a
while
one
of
the
miners
who
d
come
along
with
nick
dowd
took
our
horses
off
to
water
we
followed
nick
dowd
into
the
shack
they
d
rigged
up
a
stove
of
sorts
and
on
it
a
huge
blackened
coffeepot
steamed
other
miners
followed
in
at
our
heels
nick
dowd
found
us
a
couple
of
boxes
to
sit
on
a
small
man
in
bib
overalls
and
a
battered
derby
hat
fussed
around
the
stove
2aint
comforts
said
dowd
he
introduced
the
men
who
d
come
in
as
roper
smith
shorty
mick
the
little
hombre
in
big
overalls
very
soon
he
had
tin
mugs
filled
with
hot
black
coffee
sweetened
with
molasses
for
all
and
for
us
as
of
now
apart
from
a
few
sacks
of
gold
dust
he
winked
at
his
partners
they
all
we
d
finished
and
i
d
rolled
a
cigarette
you
came
in
that
2somepn
happened
last
after
you
d
left
the
meeting
mister
i
down
william
appleton
outside
the
palace
with
a
shotgun
i
paused
and
watched
my
words
affect
them
in
their
different
ways
it
2jest
about
leaves
everything
wide
open
for
mr
pell
and
his
bunch
observed
shorty
rest
of
the
men
there
said
nothing
but
you
could
see
they
were
hard
hit
they
were
simple
men
who
knew
a
lot
maybe
about
digging
for
gold
but
were
babes
in
arms
when
it
came
to
dealing
with
owlhooters
and
desperadoes
like
pell
and
fenton
and
the
rest
i
guess
we
d
better
hold
onto
the
gold
right
2hyar
nick
said
the
sodbuster
better
surprisingly
dan
maffrey
came
in
at
sure
asking
for
trouble
they
ll
be
on
your
necks
before
you
can
say

2durned
tootin
mister
said
the
man
called
roper
smith
we
ve
got
five
rifles
among
us
and
a
few
sixshooters
but
most
of
us
2aint
2eddicated
in
shootin
it
d
be
a
on
getting
your
gold
to
the
bank
then
we
ll
with
dan
maffreys
aim
to
avenge
himself
on
the
fenton
bunch
but
still
it
was
a
handsome
offer
so
i
chimed
in
too
that
and
hold
up
the
stage
it
ll
be
a
couple
or
three
of
them
no
more
i
reckon
we
can
deal
with
copthorne
knew
a
way
round
by
the
side
of
the
church
where
there
was
a
small
open
outbuilding
where
the
grave
digger
kept
his
spades
and
forks
and
tidying
up
implements
it
might
be
open
it
was
he
entered
and
seated
himself
in
a
huddle
upon
an
upturned
wheelbarrow
his
curious
headgear
fell
off
strange
things
were
going
on
in
his
bewildered
brain
when
a
man
was
drowning
and
towards
his
last
gasp
it
was
scientifically
supposed
his
whole
life
came
up
before
him
in
some
cinematic
outbuilding
but
this
was
happening
to
him
now
he
saw
himself
as
a
sulky
ugly
malformed
repressed
boy
then
a
young
youth
he
saw
himself
refusing
baptism
according
to
the
sect
his
parents
belonged
to
on
his
leaping
mind
flashed
pictures
of
chi
canery
and
corruption
the
growth
of
the
dea
dly
decadence
and
absorption
in
debase
ment
and
satanic
debauchery
he
didnt
know
what
to
make
of
it
but
it
was
mr
copthorne
all
right
perhaps
he
had
been
attending
some
kind
of
fancy
dress
do
in
london
very
strange
his
eyes
looked
mad
hunted
eyes
as
if
the
poor
fellow
had
rocks
in
his
head
so
the
verger
described
afterwards
speak
yes
i
travelled
down
from
london
as
the
dawn
was
breaking
and
led
the
way
in
the
stained
glass
there
were
few
passengers
on
the
plane
and
gavin
was
quickly
through
the
customs
gay
gavin
the
girl
and
her
luggage
had
disappeared
and
they
were
alone
together
the
porter
brought
gavins
bag
out
to
the
hand
and
smiled
i
want
to
check
up
on
the
flights
went
out
to
the
waiting
taxi
and
then
found
that
in
the
excitement
of
meeting
gavin
she
had
left
her
sun
glasses
on
the
veranda
she
went
quickly
back
to
fetch
them
gavin
and
the
girl
who
had
got
off
the
plane
with
him
were
talking
he
was
writing
something
in
his
pocketbook
with
a
sick
feeling
of
despair
gay
knew
that
of
course
miserable
shy
who
had
sat
at
the
little
table
for
the
first
time
a
few
days
ago
gavin
raised
his
glass
to
her
and
smiled
and
gays
heart
turned
over
i
d
like
to
do
that
gavin
drained
his
glass
and
and
then
we
ll
go
for
a
stroll
along
the
beach
a
moon
like
this
mustnt
be
wasted
he
gestured
towards
the
bay
where
the
full
moon
was
just
rising
over
the
rocks
then
laid
his
hand
on
hers
gay
smiled
at
him
only
yet
remembering
for
a
second
the
kisses
she
had
seen
him
giving
elaine
all
that
was
part
of
the
past
she
would
put
it
behind
her
she
would
never
be
jealous
again
would
even
take
larrys
advice
and
look
the
other
way
if
need
be
i
say
gavin
was
looking
over
her
shoulder
that
s
a
pretty
girl
gay
glanced
behind
her
isnt
she
gay
a
little
puzzled
went
through
to
the
bar
doc
and
lilyan
were
sitting
just
inside
having
coffee
come
and
join
us
and
bring
your
lilyan
remonstrated
they
want
to
be
tonight
so
come
and
join
us
if
you
gay
thanked
him
and
walked
out
on
to
the
terrace
thinking
that
perhaps
gavin
had
bought
a
drink
and
taken
it
outside
she
looked
round
scanning
the
tables
then
caught
her
breath
a
cold
hand
seeming
to
clutch
her
heart
gavin
was
seated
at
a
small
table
in
a
shadowy
corner
talking
animatedly
to
simone
as
gay
watched
he
offered
the
girl
a
cigarette
and
lit
it
his
hands
cupping
gay
stood
irresolute
for
a
moment
half
decided
to
go
back
and
join
lilyan
and
doc
while
she
wanted
to
do
no
more
than
run
upstairs
to
her
room
knowing
that
gavin
although
he
had
told
her
that
he
loved
her
was
already
flirting
with
a
girl
that
he
had
only
met
a
few
minutes
before
but
she
turned
away
giving
a
little
gesture
of
hopelessness
knowing
that
her
the
others
were
all
dancing
and
as
gay
drew
out
a
chair
and
sat
down
gavin
without
a
word
swept
simone
on
to
the
floor
it
doesnt
mean
anything
gay
told
herself
desperately
view
and
remembering
the
advice
that
larry
had
given
her
while
she
felt
wretched
beyond
words
his
behaviour
was
not
only
boorish
and
in
the
worst
of
taste
but
it
was
unkind
beyond
words
she
fumbled
with
the
cigarette
packet
which
lay
on
the
table
not
wanting
to
smoke
but
needing
some
action
to
help
her
control
her
feelings
come
and
lifeline
and
gay
got
up
quickly
mana
ging
he
swung
her
on
to
the
floor
gay
saw
gavin
and
simone
go
through
the
doorway
that
led
down
to
the
beach
gay
closed
her
eyes
for
a
moment
in
disgust
she
was
fully
aware
that
gavin
would
make
love
to
the
french
girl
on
the
sands
and
no
doubt
he
would
come
back
soon
and
after
simone
had
left
expect
her
to
accept
his
kisses
on
the
way
back
to
the
hotel
heart
out
over
doc
nodded
towards
the
door
you
may
consider
him
a
man
i
would
say
he
was
a
weakly
you
dont
know
gavin
i
ve
only
met
him
today
but
i
think
i
can
safely
say
that
i
know
him
a
great
deal
better
than
you
do
doc
gave
her
hand
a
shake
wake
up
gay
and
dont
even
contemplate
throwing
yourself
away
on
a
chap
like
that
you
re
a
fine
girl
intelligent
and
pretty
and
i
had
thought
you
were
sensible
too
dont
make
a
fool
of
yourself
over
someone
who
doesnt
care
two
jots
for
your
feelings
if
he
behaves
like
this
now
what
is
your
married
life
going
to
be
like
hell
doc
answered
for
her
just
hell
never
able
to
trust
him
out
of
your
sight
and
having
to
put
on
gay
nodded
i
know
that
you
re
right
doc
i
think
be
the
same
if
you
know
what
i
mean
you
sound
i
m
glad
you
re
beginning
to
see
that
you
re
wasting
your
let
him
go
and
you
wont
have
to
wait
long
for
the
right
man
for
you
to
come
along
if
i
was
thirty
years
younger
and
werent
married
to
the
sweetest
wife
in
the
world
i
d
marry
you
myself
gay
laughed
doc
was
so
kind
and
nice
and
she
hoped
that
one
day
she
would
be
able
to
see
the
situation
as
it
obviously
appeared
to
everyone
else
doc
asked
lilyan
to
dance
and
once
again
gay
found
herself
alone
at
the
table
feeling
selfconscious
and
awkward
sure
that
people
were
talking
about
the
way
gavin
was
behaving
since
they
had
seen
them
dining
together
she
opened
her
bag
to
get
out
her
compact
and
saw
graces
letter
she
drew
it
out
and
opened
it
glad
to
be
able
to
occupy
herself
so
glad
that
you
are
having
such
a
lovely
time
dearie
and
have
been
over
to
sit
with
her
father
and
do
what
i
can
for
him
so
that
she
can
get
out
to
do
her
shopping
he
s
getting
on
well
but
is
pretty
helpless
still
with
his
and
going
to
marry
a
foreigner
it
back
in
her
bag
elaine
was
engaged
to
the
man
she
had
spent
so
much
time
with
at
her
party
that
was
why
gavin
had
come
back
to
her
everything
was
quite
clear
now
and
to
her
own
surprise
gay
felt
no
heartbreak
rather
a
sense
of
relief
now
that
she
knew
why
gavin
had
come
to
see
her
knowing
that
gay
was
as
much
ashamed
for
gavin
at
the
way
he
was
behaving
as
she
was
i
made
it
myself
gay
tried
to
speak
normally
wills
often
sat
on
the
brand
new
seat
outside
the
hospital
gates
and
thought
vagrant
thoughts
at
one
time
she
had
watched
the
workmen
constructing
to
put
st
johns
casualty
department
out
of
operation
in
theory
at
least
she
would
think
of
her
self
as
a
stranger
in
these
parts
man
of
the
road
his
freedom
of
decision
and
wishing
life
would
sometimes
allow
seriousminded
women
doctors
to
blow
a
feather
and
follow
its
airy
directions
accordingly
if
i
were
needing
a
job
i
d
go
to
london
of
course
she
went
on
there
are
all
sorts
of
wonder
ful
jobs
in
london
and
i
could
one
has
to
know
something
about
fishing
and
in
liverpool
they
d
want
seafarers
i
dont
think
i
d
go
to
edinburgh
un
less
i
was
a
scot
and
wanting
to
get
home
or
perhaps
a
student
studying
to
be
a
doctor
and
i
already
know
all
was
engaged
to
nigel
had
been
for
two
years
sometimes
they
talked
on
the
theme
of
when
we
get
married
and
then
all
was
wonderful
and
perhaps
it
had
only
been
a
slip
of
the
tongue
when
nigel
had
said
only
last
that
shouted
into
her
very
soul
a
horn
of
warning
and
with
it
was
coupled
a
disembodied
fragment
of
information
seen
in
farlingham
on
an
occasion
he
had
sworn
he
had
been
standing
in
for
luke
parsons
at
his
surgery
in
little
nigel
had
every
right
to
go
where
he
when
she
was
not
free
this
much
they
had
conceded
one
to
the
other
they
rarely
found
they
were
off
duty
together
and
the
situation
would
have
been
intolerable
about
their
relationship
so
when
nigel
had
told
her
about
taking
lukes
evening
surgery
she
had
said
he
shrugged
diffidently
i
like
the
work
one
gets
plenty
of
variety
and
it
s
a
change
nigel
was
the
hospitals
junior
medical
officer
you
wont
be
free
about
nine
i
suppose
to
meet
me
for
supper
somewhere
she
had
asked
hardly
likely
my
sweet
lukes
surgery
goes
on
for
hours
if
they
get
in
before
eightthirty
even
though
they
re
standing
on
one
anothers
toes
i
ll
give
you
a
ring
ok
ok
she
had
replied
readily
so
how
could
nigel
have
been
at
the
load
of
trouble
roadhouse
very
no
she
told
phil
gubbins
a
junior
my
lad
it
was
nigels
car
anyway
nuf
121
he
probably
loaned
his
car
to
somebody
phil
he
s
always
doing
that
young
gubbins
shrugged
i
didnt
see
his
face
di
but
it
certainly
looked
like
nigel
from
the
back
dj
and
all
of
course
such
as
i
couldnt
afford
to
go
into
the
load
of
trouble
neither
can
nigel
smiled
diana
he
s
saving
up
to
get
married
remember
i
remember
quipped
the
houseman
meaning
no
offence
but
does
he
that
blonde
was
something
anybody
i
know
she
smiled
i
think
so
no
di
said
immediately
it
isnt
at
all
after
that
slight
slip
of
the
tongue
on
nigels
part
she
had
realised
it
was
important
enough
for
her
to
have
remembered
and
it
was
as
though
a
red
mist
veiled
her
usually
clear
sight
and
made
her
think
there
was
an
abyss
immediately
ahead
nigel
she
had
besought
him
you
know
that
evening
you
took
luke
parsons
surgery
and
there
was
a
woman
with
a
cyst
on
her
ear
5yees
he
lowered
his
eyes
and
kissed
her
on
the
mouth
an
act
of
devotion
he
didnt
overindulge
what
about
it
my
sweet
well
she
laughed
suddenly
in
an
upsurging
of
relief
that
stupid
gubbins
boy
thought
he
saw
you
at
the
load
of
trouble
with
a
blonde
too
imagine
nigel
was
frowning
he
looked
distinguished
when
he
frowned
boyishly
though
diana
knew
the
name
of
every
member
of
the
staff
distinguished
or
not
nigel
often
had
to
think
hard
to
sort
he
now
demanded
what
was
he
oh
he
wasnt
his
motorbike
had
broken
down
outside
and
he
noticed
your
car
and
then
you
dancing
with
this
blonde
really
nigel
cocked
one
eyebrow
actually
she
was
brunette
at
the
roots
and
i
had
a
redhead
on
the
other
arm
he
would
have
told
you
this
too
no
she
laughed
he
didnt
actually
see
you
because
it
was
your
car
i
suppose
he
presumed
it
was
you
all
dressed
up
in
my
white
or
my
black
nigel
enquired
now
i
wonder
which
i
wore
at
that
particular
surgery
you
are
a
fool
darling
di
said
happily
i
shall
take
great
pleasure
in
telling
that
young
man
exactly
what
you
were
doing
that
evening
no
dont
he
said
after
kissing
her
again
i
rather
like
to
have
the
housemen
think
of
me
as
a
twotiming
m
such
a
dull
fellow
really
dull
she
couldnt
believe
it
selfdeprecation
was
not
one
of
nigels
usual
attributes
you
need
your
holiday
darling
i
only
wish
i
could
go
with
you
doctor
i
suppose
she
enquired
archly
no
it
wouldnt
he
almost
snapped
surprising
her
you
sounded
like
some
body
else
for
a
moment
there
it
doesnt
become
you
to
behave
like
a
a
tart
di
nigel
she
gasped
i
didnt
mean
to
behave
like
anything
of
the
kind
i
miserable
enough
my
having
to
take
my
leave
in
the
autumn
without
you
trying
to
be
bright
and
gay
about
it
at
this
time
of
year
i
cant
ask
you
up
because
it
s
dont
keep
hinting
then
you
wish
you
could
come
with
me
you
hope
i
ll
miss
you
you
cant
imagine
the
hospital
without
me
for
her
figure
was
small
and
exquisite
like
a
schoolgirls
still
and
he
admired
her
legs
which
the
male
sex
were
inclined
to
regard
first
i
would
mind
if
you
didnt
he
told
her
grimly
and
tugged
her
fiercely
into
his
arms
you
re
right
pet
i
do
need
this
leave
i
m
badtempered
and
broody
and
going
out
with
brash
blondes
i
dont
deserve
you
all
the
waiting
worth
while
when
we
re
married
we
wont
have
these
explosions
of
emotion
will
we
no
he
eyed
her
strangely
i
wish
we
were
married
di
like
a
patient
wishes
his
operation
was
over
again
her
laughter
trilled
marriage
isnt
as
bad
as
an
operation
nigel
that
particular
problem
isnt
looming
at
the
moment
thank
god
problem
looming
are
we
discussing
a
marriage
he
could
be
serious
surely
marrying
me
isnt
going
to
be
all
that
bad
your
ring
back
she
loosened
the
halfhoop
of
diamonds
on
her
left
hand
third
finger
and
held
it
out
to
him
still
playfully
without
a
glimmer
of
amusement
in
his
own
eyes
however
he
took
it
looking
moodily
beyond
her
perhaps
it
s
as
well
if
you
dont
wear
it
for
a
bit
di
he
told
serious
things
like
engagements
dont
be
such
a
baby
they
were
going
almost
in
desperation
she
appealed
will
you
meet
me
at
the
gate
four
oclock
tomorrow
why
he
he
told
her
and
suddenly
seized
her
in
an
embrace
which
really
hurt
without
your
ring
it
s
just
like
and
kissed
her
again
somewhat
startled
to
what
you
d
get
she
flashed
at
him
and
so
had
left
him
on
her
dignity
and
not
seeing
the
look
of
admiration
and
revelation
which
had
followed
her
slim
young
figure
then
regarded
the
ring
which
he
retrieved
with
some
bitterness
thus
had
they
parted
the
previous
evening
and
now
diana
was
trailing
up
the
gravelled
drive
to
the
hospital
alone
of
course
one
couldnt
say
for
certain
when
a
doctor
would
be
free
during
the
day
tea
was
served
from
four
until
fivethirty
in
the
residents
common
room
which
proved
the
elasticity
of
medical
commitments
something
had
cropped
up
which
required
nigels
attention
to
database
p03189
they
often
had
such
a
rendezvous
for
there
was
just
time
to
smoke
a
cigarette
if
one
walked
slowly
between
road
and
hospital
i
wonder
you
dared
trust
well
at
least
i
know
the
truth
you
are
satisfied
and
as
he
spoke
the
thought
vulsion
that
was
homicidal
tied
he
dare
not
precipitate
what
might
well
be
another
mantle
and
said
with
such
i
will
leave
you
the
necessary
pre
his
fountainpen
from
his
his
prescription
pad
and
scribble
on
it
then
with
a
gesture
she
knew
so
well
he
tore
off
the
leaflet
and
with
a
deadly
finality
watching
him
go
unable
to
speak
she
felt
that
part
of
her
was
leaving
him
she
couldnt
hate
him
nation
now
there
was
no
thing
not
even
friendship
she
went
back
to
philip
but
all
she
could
hear
were
nicholass
love
she
revolted
against
the
word
nicholas
philip
where
was
happiness
or
peace
of
mind
philip
put
out
a
hand
and
grasped
hers
he
needed
her
she
would
find
solace
in
that
fact
at
least
she
had
her
truth
how
much
had
built
up
from
that
first
ideal
and
how
hell
lying
there
knowing
she
was
said
instinctively
i
told
him
i
knew
he
was
responsible
for
her
eyes
darkened
in
torment
are
good
heavens
darling
why
on
earth
her
word
there
was
enough
evidence
no
matter
how
one
might
want
to
touched
him
after
the
cold
wind
of
suspense
it
will
be
interesting
will
matter
most
strange
how
just
then
philip
was
so
certain
that
nicholas
would
never
betray
him
he
loved
sandra
too
deeply
to
ruin
her
future
happiness
had
ever
circum
he
was
better
he
had
made
a
miraculous
recovery
and
sandra
would
soon
be
his
wife
the
devil
he
thought
certainly
looked
after
his
own
something
in
sandras
attitude
struck
patronizing
word
she
replied
i
despise
philip
