Where
there

Observations
There
are
those
who
seem
half
inclined
not
to
admit
of
any
prosecution
for
this
offence.
The
parable
of
the
Sword
and
the
Scabbard
quoted
on
will
never
do
as
a
Rule
of
Law.
It
fails
absolutely
where
the
Wo:
:man
is
held
motionless
either
by
force
or
terror:
where
through
weariness
or
affright
her
senses
fail
her,
and
she
falls
into
a
Swoon.
It
fails
still
more
evidently
where
the
Ravisher
has
a:
:ny
one
to
assist
him.
Certain
it
is
however,
that
prosecutions
for
this
Offence
ought
to
be
regarded
with
a
jealous
eye;
and
that
the
comparative
appearance
of
the
parties
in
point
of
strength
may
furnish
evidence
of
such
force,
as
the
positive
testimony
of
any
single
person
will
hardly
countervail.
this
occasion
by
Mr
Voltaire,+
may
pass
very
well
as
a
jest,
but
a
Theft,
that
Crime
by
which
the
Passion
of
all
Passions
the
most
constant
&amp;
universal,
is
gratified
in
the
Method
of
all
Methods
the
most
simple,
is
that
with
which
we
will
begin.
Other
Offences
operating
on
the
same
Subject,
viz:
Property,
fall
short
in
point
of
Simplicity
of
this,
in
that
they
are
either
complicated
with
Inquiries
operating
on
a
different
Subject,
viz:
Person;
or
else
take
a
certain
Detour,
which
this
does
not,
to
the
Accomplishment
of
their
End
;#
or
operate
only
on
some
particular
Division
of
that
Subject
,#
or
are
perpetrable
only
By
Persons
of
a
particular
Description.
#
Simple
however
as
this
is
in
the
Mode
&amp;
Principle
of
its
Perpetration
there
is
no
Offence
that
has
in
many
Cases
the
Conception
of
it's
distinctive
Characters
more
intricate,
nor
therefore
the
Doctrine
relative
to
it
more
complicated:
owing
partly
to
what
Intricacy
of
it's
natural
Character,
and
partly
to
it's
having
been
made
by
our
own
Laws
especially
to
take
a
different
factitious
one
from
every
one
of
a
great
Variety
of
Modifications
&amp;
Relations,
as
will
be
hereafter
explained,
of
which
that
ample
Subject
is
susceptible.
Yet
of
those
other
Offences
some
XX
comparative
5.thly
&amp;
lastly.
I
shall
undertake
the
relative
Estimation
of
the
several
particular
Offences
into
which
both
Kinds
of
Distinctions
have
broken
the
general
Title.
Before
we
proceed
further,
the
employing
of
a
few
Words
in
fixing
an
Article
of
Nomenclature
will
be
by
no
Means
an
useless
Digression:
in
Order
if
possible
to
establish
that
Distinctness
of
Conception
which
is
very
necessary
to
a
commanding
Knowledge
of
the
Subject,
but
which
practical
Writers
have
appeared
little
sollicitous
to
transmit
or
to
acquire.
There
are
two
Terms
employed
and
that
often
promiscuously
in
speaking
of
the
Offence
in
Question
_
The
one
more
popular
in
it's
Use
and
ample
in
it's
Signification
_
Theft
_
The
other
more
technical
in
it's
Use
and
confined
in
it's
Signification
_
Larceny.
The
Verb
&quot;to
steal&quot;
with
it's
Participle
&quot;stealing&quot;
is
exactly
parallel
in
it's
Use
and
commensurate
in
it's
Signification
with
the
former
of
these,
being
the
same
Larceny,
or
that
the
Thing
is
under
any
intrinsic
Incapacity
of
becoming
the
Subject
of
an
Act
of
that
Nature,
but
only
that
if
it
is
stolen,
as
fairly
stolen
(if
one
may
be
allowed
the
Expression)
as
any
Thing
whatever
can
be,
[still]
the
Punishment
for
it
is
not
of
that
Kind
which,
where
has
by
the
Common
Laws
it
^originally
attached
^
bestowed
on
the
Act
that
Denomination.
In
a
Word
the
Import
of
the
Term
Theft
with
it's
Conjugates
abovementioned
is
coextensive
with
the
Moral
Idea:
Larceny
with
the
Legal.
This
Distinction
is
far
from
being
steadily
observed:
Writers
every
now
&amp;
then
stretching
the
Import
of
the
Word
Larceny
to
a
Synonimity
with
hence
it
is
that
Theft;
by
which
means
Things
are
brought
to
that
pass,
that
now
persons
discoursing
of
a
proposed
Act
might
say,
the
one
that
it
was,
the
other
that
it
was
not
Larceny,
both
having
the
same
Meaning.
_
It
is
in
Order
to
avoid
this
Confusion
that
I
give
this
Notice
once
for
all,
that
if^
I
use
this
technical
Term
in
my
own
person
I
use
it
not
in
Concurrence
with,
but
in
Contradistinction
to
the
other.
The
-so
ever
ever
he
could
imagine,
that
he
was
paving
the
way
to
a
clear
knowledge
of
Jurisprudence
by
such
unintelligible
Jargon
as
this.
Our
Ancestors
had
been
accustomed
to
hear
_
these
absurdities
from
the
pulpits,
while
it
was
possesst
by
Monkish
ignorance:
As
progress
of
reformation
is
slow,
we
are
not
always
shocked
at
ithem,
when
we
som
by
chance
we
hear
something
like
them
from
the
same
Place.
But,
surely,
in
these
en-
lightened
Days
every
man
must
feel
in-
dignation
when
he
hears
sees
an
eminent
Writer
on
jurisprudence
paint
the
Creator,
in
the
odious
colors
of
an
Egyptian
task
Master.
For
21
declares
it
to
be
in
direct
opposition
to
his
present
distinction)
then
it
is
in
ex
post
facto
law,
making
that
criminal
which
at
the
time
of
it's
commission
was
indifferent:
it
is
a
privilegium
of
which
Cicero,
as
quoted
by
our
Author,
says
_
with
a
spirit,
which
I
wish
he
had
im-
parted
to
our
author,
&quot;Nemo
unquam
&quot;tulit,
nihil
est
crudelius,
nihil
perni-
-ciosius,
nihil
quod
minus
hoc
civitas
&quot;ferre
possit.&quot;
&quot;Municipal
law
(says
our
Author)
&quot;is
also
a
rule
of
civil
conduct,
and
this
&quot;he
says
distinguishes
municipal
law
82
much
inferior
will
be
produced
hereafter
to
this
sup-

-posed
one,
will
be
produced
hereafter.
If
from
one
third
the
Fine
were
to
be
in-
creased
to
two
thirds,
the
Law
instead
of
being
better
would
now
be
just
as
bad
again
as
it
was
before_
it
is
still
as
true
as
ever,
that
after
the
punishment
suffer'd
and
over,
it
is
always
worth
a
Man's
while
to
commit
the
Crime
whenever
he
has
the
Opportunity:
and
the
Misery
of
the
Criminal
is
doubled.
Universally
therefore
the
Inexpediency
of
the
Law
is
inversely
as
the
Magnitude
of
the
Punish-
ment,
up
to
the
very
Point
at
which
that
punish-
ment
has
risen
to
an
Equality
with
the
Profit
of
the
Crime.&quot;

Where
the
Act
prohibited
is
such
as
would
pro-
-duce
Unhappiness
in
the
Community,
and
less
than
the
Penalty
actually
annexed
to
it_;
but
not
less
than
one
might
be
substituted
in
it's
Room.
Such
I
conceive
to
be
the
Laws
inflicting
capi-
tal
Punishments
on
Thefts.
Here
the
Law
simply
&amp;
absolutely
considered
shall
be
requisite
to
enforce
the
execution
of
the
same
accordingly,
and
within
a
time
to
be
limited,
And
Whereas
in
and
by
an
instrument
dated
this
day
the
said
piece
of
ground
has
been
fixed
upon
accordingly
and
the

Jeremy
Bentham
ap-
-pointed

Feoffee
for
the
purpose
of
purchasing
the

Whereas

upon
such
terms

as
are

to
erect

a

supernumerary:
as
for

at

of

in

of

pork
having
been
for
1799.
&quot;A
&quot;some
time
secured
into
the
store,
there
were
found
at
this
period
six
&quot;months
salt
provisions
remaining;
which,
without
this
supply
would
have
been
all
consumed,
and
the
colony
left
without
animal

&quot;save
in
the
article
of

a
resource
on

it
could
not
&quot;have

prudent
to
have
touched
as
a

except
in
a
case
&quot;of
the
last
necessity.
Every
encouragement
was
given
to
the
curing
of
pork
upon
Norfolk
Island;
&quot;but
the
casks
in
which
the
salt
meat
was
sent
from
England
were
in
general
so
extremely
feeble
by
the
time
they
arrived,
that
scarcely
one
in
a
&quot;hundred
was
fit
for
that
purpose
a
second

Could
any
timber,
fit
&quot;for
this
use,
have
been
found
in
the
country,
yet
a
supply
of
hoops
and
&quot;salt
pans
would
have
been
necessary;
and,
unless
it
was
cured
in
the
winter
&quot;season,
and
the
method
observed
by
Captain
Cook
was
practised
at
Norfolk

&quot;it
remained
a

whether
it

be
accomplished

any
considerable

&quot;It
having
been
for
several
days
reported,
that
&quot;the
crews
of
two
boats,
which
had
been
permitted
to
go
to
Hunter's
&quot;River
for
a
load
of
coals
,
had
been
cut
off
by
the
natives,
the
&quot;governor
ordered
his
whale
boat
to
be
well
armed,
and
to
proceed
&quot;thither,
in
quest
of
the
boats
and
their
crews;
sending
in
her
&quot;Henry
Hacking,
a
person
on
whom
he
could
depend.
Upon
his
&quot;return
he
informed
the
governor,
that
on
his
arrival
he
found
&quot;an
attempt
had
been
made
to
burn
the
smaller
boat,
which
&quot;had
had
three
men
in
her,
who
were
each
provided
with
a
&quot;musquet.
The
boat
was
there,
but
the
men
were
not
to
be
&quot;found.
Going
immediately
in
search
of
them,
he
fell
in
with
&quot;a
large
body
of
natives
all
armed.
On
desiring
them
to
inform
&quot;him
what
was
become
of
the
white
men,
they
told
him
they
&quot;were
gone
to
Sidney.
This
did
not
satisfy
him,
as
he
found
&quot;they
had
taken
away
the
sails
of
the
boats,
the
men's
blankets,
&quot;and
every
thing
that
they
had
with
them.
He
then
threatened
&quot;to
kill
them
if
they
did
not
instantly
inform
him,
&amp;
presented
&quot;his
musquet
at
them.
This
they
laughed
at,
and
said,
that
&quot;if
he
did
not
go
away,
and
leave
them
a
small
two-oared
&quot;boat
which
he
had
brought
with
him,
&amp;
the
whale
boats,
they
&quot;would
destroy
every
white
man
there,
and
poised
their
spears
in
&quot;a
threatening
manner.
He
again
levelled
his
piece
at
them,
and
&quot;snapped
it
without
priming,
in
the
hope
of
alarming
them;
but
&quot;they
were
not
so
easily
frightened,
and
became
more
noisy
and
&quot;violent.
Finding
that
an
attack
was
almost
certain,
he
charged
&quot;his
gun
with
buck
shot,
and
ordered
them
to
leave
the
place;
&quot;but,
their
clamour
increasing
,
he
fired,
and
four
of
them
fell,
one
&quot;of
whom
got
up
again
and
ran
off,
the
other
three
remaining
&quot;upon
the
ground,
probably
mortally
wounded.
The
whole
body
&quot;disappeared,
and
no
more
was
seen
seen
of
them,
leaving
Hacking
&quot;to
fill
his
boat
&amp;
effect
his
&lt;gap/&gt;
retreat
unmolested.
&quot;Our
people
having
frequently
visited
this
river
for
coals,
&amp;
&quot;always
treated
with
kindness
and
civility
the
natives
whom
they
&quot;met,
this
behaviour
was
not
to
be
accounted
for,
except
by
its
&quot;being
allowed
that
all
savages
are
under
the
dominion
of
a
&quot;sudden
impulse;
which
renders
it
impossible
to
know
when
to
&quot;trust
to
them.&quot;

&quot;A
general
muster
took
place
on
the

in
every
district
of
the
colony,
at
which
every
labouring
&quot;man,
whether
free
or
conict
convict,
was
obliged
to
appear.
on
the
&quot;following
morning
the
settlers
were
called
over,
previous
to
which,
&quot;the
governor,
who
was
present,
informed
them,
that
he
had
&quot;heard
of
much
discontent
prevailing
among
them
in
consequence
&quot;of
certain
heavy
grievances
which
they
said
they
laboured
under.
For
&quot;then,
as
he
was
unacquainted
with
the
nature
of
them,
he
was
&quot;unable
to
suggest
any
remedy,
he
therefore
desure
desired
that
&quot;they
might
be
represented
to
him
in
writing;
and,
to
spare
&quot;them
as
much
trouble
as
possible,
he
would
direct
two
gentle-
-&quot;men
on
whom
he
had
much
dependance
to
visit
the
different
&quot;districts,
and
collect
from
the
respective
settlers
such
of
their
&quot;distresses
and
grievances
as
they
were
desier
desire
desirous
of
&quot;making
known.
Before
they
were
dismissed,
he
gave
them
much
&quot;good
advice;
and
assured
them,
that
he
had
already,
from
his
&quot;own
ideas,
offered

to

of

for

&quot;benefit,
which
he
hoped
in

would
be

fice
In

truth
compells
me
to
ac-
-knowlegdge,

would
be

legal
fails
me:
rumour

notoriety
_
whatsoever
be

is
in
several
points
the
only
ground
I
can
exhi-
-bit
even
so
much
as
in
the
way
of
reference.
I
have
no
eye-witness
to
depose,
that
as
often
as
a
Noble
Secretary
hias
appeared
to
act,
a
gentleman
on
the
other
side
the
wainscoat
has
pulled
the
wirer.
Friendship
between
the
gentleman
who
popp'd
out
of
his
pocket,
and
the
gentlemen
out
of
whose
pocket
the
other
popped,
is
a
point
not
less
diffi-
-cult
to
prove,
at
least
by
the
evidence
of
sense.
The
Nobel
Lord
and
the
gentleman
on
the
other
side
of
the
wainscoat
could,
either
of
them,
by
their
evidence
put
both
points
out
of
doubt.
Fortunately

unfortunately
the
favourite

maxim
about
self-crimination
and
self-depredation,
the
maxim
made

so
that
on
this
occasion,
as
on
all
others,
they
may
do
exactly
as
they
please.

these
obscure
and
delicate
