to
go
to
a
place
where
I
am
to
be
commanded
and
directed
by
another,
who
can
have
no
other
pretence,
than
that
of
having
a
commi[-
sion
from
the
King.
We
shall
suffer
very
greatly
in
a
little
time,
for
want
of
Clothing
for
the
Soldiers;
and
none
can
be
had
here,
nor
in
short,
I
believe
in
the
Country.
Those
which
Carlyle
and
Dalton
con-
tracted
to
furnish,
we
are
disappointed
in;
and
they
say,
they
have
searched
all
the
Stores
in
Maryland,
as
well
as
this
part
of
Virginia,
and
none
are
able
to
furnish
Clothes.
We
have
sustained
inconceivable
lo[ses
by
the
commi[-
saries
delays:
many
of
the
Carolina
Beeves
are
dead,
through
poverty
and
bad
manage-
ment;
and
the
chief
of
them
are
too
poor
to
slaughter.
Pray
make
my
Compliments
to
my
Friends
below;
and
believe
me

P.S.
The
Committee,
I
believe,
have
not
yet
fixed
the
pay
of
the
Lieutenant
Colonel

Major.
Pray
propose
it,
and
let
me
know
their
Resolves.
